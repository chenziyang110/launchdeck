## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `$sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



## Workflow Contract Summary

- **When to use**: The current spec package exists, but one or more capabilities do not yet have a credible implementation chain.
- **Primary objective**: Coordinate focused research and isolated prototype evidence, synthesize implementation-chain decisions, and produce a planning handoff before /sp-plan.
- **Primary outputs**: `FEATURE_DIR/deep-research.md` with `Planning Handoff`, optional `FEATURE_DIR/research-spikes/`, updated `alignment.md`, `context.md`, `references.md`, and `workflow-state.md`.
- **Default handoff**: $sp-plan when feasibility is proven or explicitly accepted; otherwise /sp-clarify for requirement gaps or stop with blocked research risks.
- **Execution note**: This summary is routing metadata only. Follow the full contract below end-to-end rather than inferring behavior from the description alone.

## Blocked Exit Contract

If blocked after safe recovery, read and follow
`.specify/templates/workflow-blocker-template.md` and its JSON schema. Never
return only an error or “ask a human”; preserve state and keep agent-capable
repair agent-owned. Set `human_action_required: true` only for authority,
credentials, protected systems, human decisions/reviews, or physical access.
Tailor steps, expected results, failure paths, evidence, and resume action to
CI, visual review, or product decisions. Never claim completion.

For a feature runtime blocker, do not invent `resume_argv` or overwrite an
existing blocker. The CLI returns a read-only `show_argv` and structured
`resolution_action`; `next_argv` stays empty while evidence is missing. After
the criteria are proven, attach sanitized evidence using the action's declared
input and execute its base argv. It restores the same owner and keeps the full
blocker audit.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Objective

Produce a planning-ready research packet before implementation planning starts:
prove or retire planning-critical feasibility questions, synthesize external and
repository evidence, validate uncertain links with disposable demo spikes when
needed, and hand `/sp.plan` the constraints and recommended implementation
direction it must preserve.

## Context

- Primary inputs: the current spec package, unresolved feasibility risks,
  external references, repository evidence, research-agent findings, and any
  disposable prototype evidence created in this command.
- The active working set is `spec.md`, `alignment.md`, `context.md`,
  `references.md`, `deep-research.md`, `research-spikes/`, and
  `workflow-state.md` inside the current `FEATURE_DIR`.
- This command is research-only. It is not permission to implement production
  behavior.

## Process

- Decide whether a feasibility and research handoff gate is actually needed.
- Decompose unknown implementation chains by capability and independent
  research track.
- Dispatch subagents when independent research tracks can run in parallel and
  produce evidence packets without conflicting writes.
- Research external APIs, libraries, algorithms, platform constraints, and
  repository patterns only where those facts change planning.
- Build the smallest disposable demo or spike when research alone cannot prove
  the chain.
- Synthesize research-agent findings and spike results into planning decisions,
  rejected options, risks, and a concrete `/sp.plan` handoff.
- Run reverse coverage validation before handoff: every CAP → PH → Evidence chain must close.
- Run readiness refusal checks; refuse handoff with a gap report when checks fail.
- Run the Planning Handoff Readiness Checklist; do not recommend `/sp.plan` until all items pass.

## Output Contract

- Write or update `deep-research.md`.
- Optionally write isolated scratch assets under `research-spikes/`.
- Update `alignment.md`, `context.md`, `references.md`, and `workflow-state.md`
  when feasibility evidence changes planning readiness.
- If this gate is not needed, still write a lightweight `deep-research.md`
  with `**Status**: Not needed`, `Feasibility Decision`, `Planning Handoff`,
  and `Next Command`; do not invent `CAP/TRK/EVD/PH` IDs for already-proven
  work.
- Include a `Planning Handoff` section that `/sp.plan` can consume directly for
  recommended approach, module boundaries, API/library choices, demo artifacts,
  constraints, rejected options, and residual risks.
- Use stable traceability IDs (`CAP-###`, `TRK-###`, `EVD-###`, `SPK-###`,
  `PH-###`) plus an evidence quality rubric so `/sp.plan` can cite exactly which
  research finding or spike supports each design decision.
- Use `.specify/templates/examples/deep-research/` as the output-shape
  reference when available: `not-needed.md`, `docs-only-evidence.md`, and
  `spike-required.md`.
- Report which capabilities are proven, constrained, blocked, or no longer worth
  planning.
- Persist accepted evidence packets as `FEATURE_DIR/research-evidence/<EVD-###>.json`.

## Guardrails

- Do not edit production source files, tests, migrations, release config, or
  implementation artifacts from `sp-deep-research`.
- Keep demos disposable and isolated under `FEATURE_DIR/research-spikes/` unless
  the user explicitly asks to preserve a prototype elsewhere in a later
  implementation workflow.
- Skip this command when the change is a minor adjustment to an existing,
  already-proven capability.
- Do not let research subagents edit production files; they must either
  return evidence packets or write only to their assigned disposable spike
  directory.
- A research pass without runnable evidence (spike result or repo path trace) is a failed pass.
- Coordinator-only execution without subagent dispatch justification and recorded `subagent-blocked` reason is a failed pass.
- Feasibility claims based only on documentation citations without live repository path reads are not sufficient for planning.
- Subagent evidence packets without `paths_read` must be rejected; do not accept or synthesize them.
- A structural-only refresh (reformatting findings without new evidence) is a failed pass.
- Treat `context.md` Locked Decisions as immutable constraints during research.
  Do not research alternatives that contradict a locked decision unless the
  research explicitly proves the locked decision is infeasible, in which case
  mark the affected CAP as `blocked` and escalate; do not silently replace the
  locked decision.

## Senior Consequence Analysis Gate

Run this gate whenever the request, artifact set, defect, or planned change can affect lifecycle operations, running objects, concurrent work, destructive behavior, shared state, downstream consumers, compatibility, security-sensitive behavior, or multiple plausible product behaviors.

Also trigger it for a new or changed entry point over an existing operation, a direct/background/headless/system entry point, or a changed consumer or interaction owner. Build the result inventory from current result/error definitions, existing consumers, state transitions, tests, and UI/window/request/retry owners. Reusing an executor proves operation reuse; it does not prove that the new consumer preserves every terminal, recoverable, partial, cancelled, or user-input-required outcome.

Project cognition first. Use the project cognition runtime to identify ownership, consumers, state surfaces, change-propagation facts, verification routes, conflicts, known unknowns, and coverage gaps. Senior consequence analysis second. Turn those facts into explicit product and implementation obligations instead of treating the graph as the decision-maker.

Project cognition readiness provides navigation state; route recovery by `recommended_next_action.action_id`. If readiness is `query_ready`, read top-level `minimal_live_reads` first, then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons. If readiness is `review`, inspect the returned `minimal_live_reads` before continuing and treat `coverage_diagnostics` as confidence and closeout signals. If readiness is `needs_rebuild`, preserve resumable non-rebuild actions such as `complete_scan_packets`; only `action_id=project_cognition.rebuild` may consume `rebuild_reasons[]` and `recommended_next_action.workflow_routes.classic.steps` as a rebuild handoff. That rebuild route remains reserved for brownfield first/missing/unusable baseline, schema failure, schema v1 or old broad-schema rebuild-required readiness, zero active-generation `path_index` rows outside `greenfield_empty`, missing or invalid `alias_index`, `explicit_rebuild_requested`, or `baseline_identity_invalid`. If readiness is `blocked`, report the blocked state and continue with live repository evidence unless the user's actual request is to fix cognition runtime state. If readiness is `unsupported_runtime`, continue with live evidence and record that compass intake was unavailable. If `baseline_kind=greenfield_empty`, continue with workflow artifacts and live requirements; do not recommend map-scan -> map-build solely because the graph has no paths. Carry relevant project cognition facts, returned `minimal_live_reads`, inference notes, and coverage gaps into the workflow's artifacts or durable state, but back consequence claims with live code, tests, scripts, configuration, or authoritative docs. Mutation closeout is separate from entry routing: entry stale may continue, but that does not allow source/runtime mutation workflows to defer closeout. Workflow-owned mutation closeout is not an external map-maintenance handoff; after changing project-related files or behavior, the workflow must run inline project cognition update from its changed paths, affected surfaces, and verification evidence, with `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe mark-dirty` only as fallback when inline update cannot complete. `sp-map-update` is for manual/external maintenance and follow-up repair; it is external map maintenance, not routine closeout for this workflow's own changes. In shared routing summaries, sp-map-update is for manual/external maintenance and ordinary existing-baseline gaps.

Required output when the gate triggers:

- **Affected Object Map**: name each object, record, worker, queue, artifact, command, API, file surface, user-visible state, or downstream consumer that can be affected.
- **State-Behavior Matrix**: describe behavior for each important lifecycle state, including created, queued, running, paused, failed, cancelled, completed, resumed, archived, missing, stale, or partially refreshed states when relevant.
- **Dependency Impact Table**: map direct dependencies, indirect consumers, shared state, compatibility surfaces, validation routes, and adjacent workflows that can break if semantics change.
- **Recovery And Validation Contract**: state rollback, retry, idempotency, cleanup, migration, observability, and validation evidence required before handoff or completion.
- **Coverage Gaps**: list what project cognition or live evidence cannot prove, who must resolve each gap, the latest safe resolve phase, the stop-and-reopen condition, and the routing decision: current workflow may continue with an assumption, must ask the user, must route to clarification or deep research, or must request map maintenance.
- **Consequence Obligations**: assign stable `CA-###` IDs to every obligation that must survive downstream handoff, task generation, worker packets, verification, or debug closeout. Each `CA-###` must include claim, affected objects, owner workflow, latest resolve phase, status, and stop-and-reopen condition.
- **Entrypoint Outcome Contract**: when the entry-point trigger applies, persist `entrypoint_outcome_contract` in `spec-contract.json`. Keep live-evidence-backed result inventory separate from product dispositions, and map every preserved or adapted outcome to acceptance refs and `CA-###` consequence refs. Plan and Tasks consume those CA refs through the existing consequence chain; do not create a parallel outcome ledger downstream.

Stand down only for docs-only wording changes, trivial isolated fixes, or local refactors that cannot affect lifecycle operations, running state, destructive operations, shared state, downstream consumers, compatibility, security, or multiple behavior choices. Record the no-trigger reason or stand-down reason in the workflow's durable artifact or closeout before skipping the required outputs.

If the gate triggers and the current workflow cannot preserve the required outputs, stop and route to the workflow that can. Do not mark ready, resolved, handoff-ready, planning-ready, or complete while triggered consequence obligations remain unresolved, unmapped, or unsupported by validation evidence.

## Mandatory Subagent Execution

All substantive tasks in ordinary `sp-*` workflows default to and must use subagents.

The leader orchestrates: route, split tasks, prepare task contracts, dispatch subagents, wait for structured handoffs, integrate results, verify, and update state.

Before dispatch, every subagent lane needs a task contract with objective, authoritative inputs, allowed read/write scope, forbidden paths, acceptance checks, verification evidence, and structured handoff format.

Use `execution_model: subagent-mandatory`.
Use `dispatch_shape: one-subagent | parallel-subagents`.
Use `execution_surface: native-subagents`.


## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before deep research)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_deep_research` key.
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable.
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently.

**Maintain workflow quality without hook choreography**:
- Confirm project cognition freshness and valid workflow entry before deeper research begins.
- Keep `workflow-state.md` current as the durable research-session truth for
  allowed artifact writes, next action, and exit criteria; it does not own
  required-stage order or runtime revision.
- Verify the final `deep-research.md` and `workflow-state.md` outputs before handoff instead of relying on chat narration.
- Update durable state before compaction-risk transitions, prototype-evidence synthesis handoffs, or any stop where resume will depend on more than the visible conversation.

## Project Learning

The CLI is the only agent-facing Learning read surface:

1. Run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify learning start --command '<classic-command-name>' --format json` before deeper non-trivial work.
2. Select summaries by applicability and triggers; use `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify learning list --command '<classic-command-name>' --format json` only to filter or page.
3. Execute one matching card's `show_argv`. Do not parse Learning storage.

After minimal live inspection identifies a reused operation or changed entry point, rerun targeted recall with current code, tests, and task/contract evidence, for example `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify learning list --command '<classic-command-name>' --context 'operation_owner=<owner>' --context 'consumer_owner=<consumer>' --context 'outcome=<result-family>' --format json`. Do not derive these facets from archived specifications. An exact operation-owner match may surface a cross-command candidate even when the new consumer differs; treat it as a candidate, expand one `show_argv`, verify it against live evidence, and do not auto-apply it.

When the entrypoint outcome audit is triggered, persist the live facets as `learning_context`, the contextual invocation as `learning_search_refs`, and returned refs as `learning_candidate_refs`. Record exactly one `applied`, `not_applicable`, or `deferred` item in `learning_dispositions` for every candidate. Do not silently ignore a candidate: applied Learning traces to requirement/consequence refs, not-applicable needs current evidence, and deferred needs an explicit deferral ref.

`start`, `list`, and `show` are read-only. Current repository evidence,
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and explicit user direction override stale or
candidate Learning.

At closeout, corrections, retries, route changes, recovery, false leads, hidden
dependencies, validation/tooling/state/cognition gaps, constraints, and near
misses are capture signals. Prefer `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify learning capture-auto`
from owning state; manual capture includes summary, problem, action, triggers,
success criteria, avoid items, exceptions, and evidence.

- `fast`: skip unless the task escalates.
- `accept`, `analyze`, `ask`, `auto`, `constitution`, `explain`,
  `implement-teams`, `taskstoissues`, and `team`: consume-only; do not violate
  their write boundaries to capture.
- Other non-trivial workflows: consume before deeper work; capture reusable
  signals at closeout or record a no-learning decision.

The `policy` returned by the CLI is authoritative when prompt wording drifts.

## Workflow Phase Lock

- [AGENT] Before any artifact or rich-state write, run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify workflow show --feature-dir '<feature-dir>' --format json`. `FEATURE_DIR/workflow-runtime.json` is CLI-owned and this auxiliary workflow must not write it. The expected required-stage owner is `specify`. If the runtime is missing, corrupt, at another stage, or already completed, stop with its blocker or a typed owner handoff naming the observed stage, expected owner, affected files, exact next action, unblock criteria, and resume argv; do not overwrite either state surface to force entry.
- [AGENT] Create or resume `WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE` before substantial research.
- Read `.specify/templates/workflow-state-template.md`.
- If `WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE` already exists, read it first and preserve still-valid `next_action`, `exit_criteria`, and `next_command` details instead of relying on chat memory alone.
- Treat `WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE` as the resume/evidence source of truth after
  compaction for this research command: allowed writes, forbidden actions,
  authoritative files, next action, and exit criteria. It is not the
  required-stage phase lock.
- Set or update the state for this run with at least:
  - `active_command: sp-deep-research`
  - `phase_mode: research-only`
  - `allowed_artifact_writes: deep-research.md, research-spikes/, alignment.md, context.md, references.md, workflow-state.md`
  - `forbidden_actions: edit production source code, edit tests, fix build/tooling, implement behavior, commit prototype code as production`
  - `authoritative_files: spec.md, alignment.md, context.md, references.md, deep-research.md`
  - `track_exit_states`: per TRK-### exit state
  - `evidence_packet_acceptance`: accepted and rejected packet lists with reasons
  - `failed_readiness_checks`: list of check IDs that failed
  - `open_gaps`: gap ID, description, severity, and linked CAP/TRK IDs
  - `entry_source`: `sp-specify` | `sp-clarify` (which command routed here)
  - `research_mode`: `full-research` | `supplement-research`
- Do not edit production code, production tests, migrations, release config, or implementation artifacts from `sp-deep-research`.
- When resuming after compaction, re-read `WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE` before proceeding.

## Multi-Agent Research Orchestration

- [AGENT] Treat the current session as the research coordinator. The coordinator owns scope control, join points, conflict resolution, and the final `deep-research.md` synthesis.
- [AGENT] Before delegating, split the feasibility problem into independent research tracks only when the tracks can run in parallel without sharing write targets. Good tracks include:
  - repository implementation-pattern evidence
  - external API/library/platform feasibility
  - data shape, migration, permission, performance, or integration constraints
  - alternative approach comparison
  - disposable demo/spike validation
- [AGENT] Dispatch subagents when independent tracks can run in parallel and that materially improves evidence quality or speed. When the next coordinator decision is blocked on a single tightly coupled fact, either create one safe packetized evidence lane for that fact or stop for escalation/recovery with the blocker recorded.
- [AGENT] Give each subagent one bounded track, one expected output shape, and one write scope. Research-only subagents should return evidence packets in their final response. Demo/spike subagents may write only under `FEATURE_DIR/research-spikes/<track-slug>/`.
- [AGENT] Do not duplicate work across subagents. If two tracks overlap, assign one owner and ask the other to focus on a distinct risk or alternative.
- [AGENT] Require every subagent to return an evidence packet with:
  - `track`
  - `question`
  - `sources_or_repo_evidence`
  - `finding`
  - `confidence: high | medium | low`
  - `planning_implications`
  - `constraints_for_sp_plan`
  - `rejected_options`
  - `residual_risks`
  - `spike_artifacts` when applicable
- [AGENT] After each subagent returns, apply the evidence packet acceptance protocol:
  - **ACCEPT** when: `paths_read` is non-empty, `finding` is specific and evidence-backed, core question is answered, and no production files were edited.
  - **REJECT** when: `paths_read` is empty or missing, `finding` is empty or only speculative, core question is unanswered, or the subagent edited production source files.
  - Record every acceptance and rejection in `workflow-state.md`.
  - For rejected packets: retry once with clarified instructions. If the retry also fails, mark the track as `blocked`, record `subagent-blocked` with the rejection reason, and escalate.
  - Do not silently ignore or synthesize rejected evidence packets.

  ```markdown
  ## Evidence Packet Acceptance

  | Track | Subagent | Status | Reason if Rejected | Action |
  |-------|----------|--------|--------------------|--------|
  | TRK-001 | agent-1 | ACCEPTED | — | — |
  | TRK-002 | agent-2 | REJECTED | No paths_read | Retry once |
  | TRK-003 | agent-3 | REJECTED | Edited source file | BLOCKED, escalate |
  ```
- [AGENT] Join all subagent results before writing final conclusions. Resolve contradictions by preferring runnable spike evidence, current repository evidence, primary documentation, then secondary sources in that order. Mark conflicts that remain unresolved instead of hiding them.
- [AGENT] The coordinator must convert subagent packets into `Research Agent Findings`, `Synthesis Decisions`, and `Planning Handoff`; do not paste raw subagent output as the final artifact.
- [AGENT] After accepting a subagent evidence packet, persist it as
  `FEATURE_DIR/research-evidence/<EVD-###>.json` with the full evidence packet
  fields plus the evidence quality rubric. This enables:
  - independent audit without re-parsing `deep-research.md`
  - direct citation by `/sp.plan` via evidence ID
  - safe context-compaction recovery
- [AGENT] If subagent dispatch is unavailable or unsafe, record the decision as `subagent-blocked` with the concrete reason, preserve the decomposed tracks as blocked work, and stop for escalation or recovery instead of continuing as coordinator-only execution.

## Traceability and Evidence Quality Contract

- Assign stable IDs before running research so later planning can cite specific evidence instead of paraphrasing it:
  - capability IDs: `CAP-001`, `CAP-002`, ...
  - research track IDs: `TRK-001`, `TRK-002`, ...
  - evidence IDs: `EVD-001`, `EVD-002`, ...
  - spike IDs: `SPK-001`, `SPK-002`, ...
  - Planning Handoff item IDs: `PH-001`, `PH-002`, ...
- Use the IDs consistently across `Capability Feasibility Matrix`, `Research Agent Findings`, `Implementation Chain Evidence`, `Demo / Spike Evidence`, `Synthesis Decisions`, and `Planning Handoff`.
- Every handoff item must trace back to at least one evidence ID, spike ID, repository path, or source reference.
- Grade each evidence item using this rubric:
  - **Source tier**: `repo-evidence | runnable-spike | primary-docs | official-example | standard | secondary-source | inference`
  - **Reproduced locally**: `yes | no | not applicable`
  - **Recency**: [date, version, or `not time-sensitive`]
  - **Confidence**: `high | medium | low`
  - **Plan impact**: `blocking | constraining | informative`
  - **Limitations**: [what the evidence does not prove]
- Stop each research track when it reaches one of these exit states:
  - `enough-to-plan`
  - `constrained-but-plannable`
  - `blocked`
  - `not-viable`
  - `user-decision-required`
  - `stale-needs-revalidation` — prior evidence may no longer be valid due to dependency or platform changes
- Do not continue researching a track once it has enough evidence to support a planning decision. Convert the result into a handoff item and move on.
- For every spike, record the reproducibility contract:
  - hypothesis
  - setup/env
  - command
  - expected result
  - actual result
  - cleanup note
  - what this does not prove

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -PathsOnly` from repo root once (`--json --paths-only` / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse:
   - If `FEATURE_DIR` is not already explicit, prefer `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify lane resolve --command deep-research --ensure-worktree` before guessing from branch-only context.
   - When lane resolution returns a materialized lane worktree, continue research from that isolated worktree context instead of assuming the leader workspace already matches the active feature lane.
   - `FEATURE_DIR`
   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - optional downstream paths if returned
   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct the user to verify the feature branch environment.
   - Set `ALIGNMENT_FILE` to `FEATURE_DIR/alignment.md`.
   - Set `CONTEXT_FILE` to `FEATURE_DIR/context.md`.
   - Set `REFERENCES_FILE` to `FEATURE_DIR/references.md`.
   - Set `DEEP_RESEARCH_FILE` to `FEATURE_DIR/deep-research.md`.
   - Set `SPIKES_DIR` to `FEATURE_DIR/research-spikes`.
   - Set `WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE` to `FEATURE_DIR/workflow-state.md`.

2. **Create or resume the workflow state**:
   - Read `.specify/templates/workflow-state-template.md`.
   - If `WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE` already exists, read it first and preserve still-valid `next_action`, `exit_criteria`, and `next_command` details instead of relying on chat memory alone.
   - Determine entry source:
     - If the prior `active_command` in `workflow-state.md` was `sp-specify` →
       `entry_source: sp-specify`, `research_mode: full-research`
     - If the prior `active_command` was `sp-clarify` →
       `entry_source: sp-clarify`, `research_mode: supplement-research`
     - If undetermined → default to `full-research`
   - In `supplement-research` mode, preserve existing evidence and only research
     newly added or changed capabilities.
   - Record entry source and research mode in `deep-research.md` Research
     Orchestration section.
   - Persist at least:
     - `active_command: sp-deep-research`
     - `phase_mode: research-only`
     - `allowed_artifact_writes: deep-research.md, research-spikes/, alignment.md, context.md, references.md, workflow-state.md`
     - `forbidden_actions: edit production source code, edit tests, fix build/tooling, implement behavior, commit prototype code as production`
     - `authoritative_files: spec.md, alignment.md, context.md, references.md, deep-research.md`

3. **Load current spec package and repository context**:
   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - `FEATURE_DIR/alignment.md`
   - `FEATURE_DIR/context.md`
   - `FEATURE_DIR/references.md` if present
   - `FEATURE_DIR/deep-research.md` if present
   - `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if present
   - `.specify/memory/project-rules.md` if present
   - compact `learning start --command deep-research` results and only selected `learning show` records
   - **Project cognition gate:** query the active project's runtime before broad
     repository reads.

     Run or emulate:

     ```text
     C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe compass --intent research '--query="$ARGUMENTS"' --format json
     ```

     After the default compass packet, run the advanced `lexicon -> semantic_intake -> query` path only when `compass_state`, coverage diagnostics, localization, or live evidence requires explicit concept decisions. In that escalation, use `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe lexicon --mode catalog` as the alias catalog, write agent-authored `semantic_intake` and `concept_decisions`, then run `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe query --query-plan "<query_plan_json>"`; include `query_plan`, `semantic_intake`, `concept_decisions`, `covered_facets`, `missing_facets`, `match_sources`, `lexicon_generation_id`, `repository_search_terms`, project-language search terms, and facet coverage; do not search only the raw user words before source search. Agent-owned semantic normalization remains mandatory: `agent_normalization` and raw lexicon ranking are bootstrap signals only; if `agent_normalization` is omitted, treat it as `required=false`; use `write_semantic_intake_from_alias_catalog` when needed. Raw lexicon ranking is only a bootstrap; CJK or mixed CJK/ASCII input still requires agent-owned normalization even when positive raw lexical matches exist. The agent still owns translation. Readiness values are `query_ready`, `review`, `needs_rebuild`, `blocked`, and `unsupported_runtime`.

     Use the returned readiness:

     - `query_ready`: read top-level `minimal_live_reads` first, then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons.
     - `review`: perform only the returned `minimal_live_reads` before continuing and inspect `coverage_diagnostics`.
     - `needs_rebuild`: route by `recommended_next_action.action_id`, not readiness alone. Preserve resumable actions such as `complete_scan_packets`; only `action_id=project_cognition.rebuild` may consume `rebuild_reasons[]` and `recommended_next_action.workflow_routes.classic.steps` as a rebuild handoff.
     - `blocked`: report the blocking runtime issue and continue with live evidence only where this workflow allows degraded navigation.
     - **CARRY FORWARD**: Treat project-cognition results as repository-grounded
       starting context. Preserve cited capabilities, constraints, affected
       surfaces, and verification routes in `deep-research.md`, and distinguish
       repository facts from external research findings.
   - From `FEATURE_DIR/alignment.md`, extract:
     - `Feasibility / Deep Research Gate` status per capability
     - `Planning Gate Recommendation`
     - Capabilities marked `Needed before plan` → these are the research targets
     - Capabilities marked `Not needed` or `Completed` → skip, do not research
     - Capabilities marked `Blocked` → preserve blocker, record reason, do not research unless unblocked
   - targeted live files only when the project cognition runtime cannot prove the current implementation pattern
   - external docs, API references, release notes, examples, or research material when they materially affect feasibility

3b. **Detect staleness and prior evidence**:
    - If `FEATURE_DIR/deep-research.md` already exists from a prior run, compare
      new findings against prior conclusions.
    - For each CAP with prior evidence, check whether dependencies (library
      versions, API endpoints, platform behavior) have changed since the last
      research pass.
    - Mark CAPs with potentially stale evidence as `stale-needs-revalidation`
      and prioritize their research tracks.
    - Record staleness triggers (version bumps, deprecation notices, etc.) in
      the track description.

    ```markdown
    ## Differential Evidence Analysis

    | CAP ID | Previous Conclusion | Previous Evidence | New Evidence | Status Change |
    |--------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------|---------------|
    | CAP-001 | proven | EVD-001 | EVD-005 confirms | Unchanged |
    | CAP-002 | constrained | EVD-002 | SPK-003 disproves | **OVERTURNED** → blocked |
    | CAP-003 | proven (2026-03) | EVD-004 | lib X v3→v4 | **STALE** → revalidate |
    ```

4. **Decide whether this gate is needed**:
   - Skip deep research and recommend `/sp.plan` when all target capabilities already have a known implementation path in the repository or the work is only a minor adjustment to existing behavior.
   - When skipping, still write a lightweight `deep-research.md` using `**Status**: Not needed`, `Feasibility Decision`, `Planning Handoff`, and `Next Command`; do not invent `CAP/TRK/EVD/PH` IDs for work that is already proven.
   - Continue when any capability depends on an unproven API, library, algorithm, platform behavior, data volume, permission boundary, external integration, performance envelope, generated-code workflow, native/plugin bridge, or other path where planning would otherwise guess.
   - If the uncertainty is a requirement gap rather than feasibility risk, recommend `/sp.clarify` and update `workflow-state.md` with that route reason.

5. **Build a capability feasibility matrix from the spec's capability decomposition**:
   - Start from the capability list in `spec.md`. Each spec capability maps to one CAP-###.
   - Do not invent new capability names; use the spec's decomposition as the source of truth.
   - If a spec capability is too broad for focused research, split it into sub-capabilities (CAP-001a, CAP-001b) and note the split in `alignment.md`.
   - For each capability, read its feasibility status from `alignment.md` and take action:

   | Alignment Status | Action |
   |-----------------|--------|
   | `Needed before plan` | Create research track, assign TRK-### |
   | `Not needed` | Mark `proven` or `not needed`, skip |
   | `Completed` | Preserve existing evidence, skip |
   | `Blocked` | Record blocker, do not research |

5b. **Consequence-Sensitive Research Tracks**:
   - If the Senior Consequence Analysis Gate is triggered or upstream artifacts carry `CA-###` consequence obligations, create research tracks for any unproven affected object, state-behavior matrix entry, dependency impact, recovery behavior, validation route, or coverage gap that planning would otherwise guess.
   - Each consequence-sensitive `TRK-###` must name the linked `CA-###` obligation, the stop-and-reopen condition it can clear or confirm, the evidence needed, and the downstream workflow that must consume the result.
   - Research outputs must not drop `CA-###` consequence obligations; carry them into `Planning Handoff`, `Synthesis Decisions`, `Validation implications`, and residual risks until they are resolved or explicitly deferred.
   - If evidence disproves an upstream consequence assumption, preserve the obligation as blocked, record the stop-and-reopen condition, and route back to `/sp.clarify` instead of handing ambiguous semantics to `/sp.plan`.
   - When a consequence obligation is proven enough for planning, record the evidence ID, affected objects, lifecycle states covered, dependency impact, recovery and validation contract, remaining coverage gaps, and whether the obligation is still open.

   For each capability or module slice, record:
   - stable capability ID (`CAP-###`) — mapped from spec capability name
   - capability name (from spec.md)
   - desired outcome (from spec.md)
   - current evidence from the repository
   - unknown implementation-chain link
   - research questions
   - independent research track owner when delegation is useful
   - whether a disposable demo is required
   - proof target: what evidence would be enough to plan safely
   - result status: `proven`, `constrained`, `not viable`, `blocked`, or `not needed`

   Before finalizing the matrix, check each CAP against the preset research dimensions.
   At minimum, confirm or mark "not applicable" for:
   - permissions / auth boundary
   - data volume / performance envelope
   - error / exception / rollback flow
   - concurrency / consistency
   - logging / observability
   - migration / compatibility
   - external dependency SLO / failure mode
   - template / generated-code propagation
   - minimum verifiable test path

6. **Select the research dispatch shape**:
   - [AGENT] Before research fan-out begins, assess workload shape and the current agent capability snapshot, then apply the shared policy contract: `choose_subagent_dispatch(command_name="deep-research", snapshot, workload_shape)`.
   - Persist the decision fields exactly: `execution_model: subagent-mandatory`, `dispatch_shape: one-subagent | parallel-subagents`, `execution_surface: native-subagents`.
   - Decision order is fixed:
     - One safe validated track -> `one-subagent` on `native-subagents` when available.
     - Two or more safe isolated tracks -> `parallel-subagents` on `native-subagents` when available.
     - No safe lane, overlapping write scopes, missing contract, or unavailable delegation -> `subagent-blocked` with a recorded reason.
   - For `deep-research`, safe fan-out means at least two independent research tracks with disjoint write scopes. Research-only tracks return evidence packets; demo tracks write only under their assigned `FEATURE_DIR/research-spikes/<track-slug>/`.
   - Required join points:
     - before final conflict resolution
     - before writing `Synthesis Decisions`
     - before writing `Planning Handoff`
   - Record the chosen strategy, reason, any `subagent-blocked` condition, selected research tracks, write scopes, and join points in `deep-research.md`.
   - Keep the shared workflow language integration-neutral. Do not present Codex-only runtime surface wording in this shared template.

7. **Plan and run coordinated research**:
   - Create research tracks from the capability matrix before searching broadly.
   - For each track, assign a stable track ID (`TRK-###`) and define the exact question, evidence target, likely sources, whether a spike is needed, and how the result will affect `/sp.plan`.
   - If two or more tracks are independent and subagent dispatch is available, dispatch bounded subagents according to the Multi-Agent Research Orchestration contract.
   - If subagent dispatch is unavailable or low-confidence, record `subagent-blocked`, capture which tracks could not be dispatched, and stop before substantive research until the block is resolved or explicitly escalated.
   - Search and read only sources that answer a named feasibility question.
   - Prefer primary docs, official examples, standards, changelogs, release notes, library docs, code examples from the dependency itself, and current repository evidence.
   - Cite external sources in `references.md` and summarize how each source affects the implementation chain.
   - Separate facts from inference. If one source is weak or unverified, say so.
   - Preserve rejected alternatives with explicit reasons when they matter to planning.
   - Convert every completed track into an evidence packet with stable evidence IDs (`EVD-###`), evidence quality ratings, limitations, and a track exit state.

8. **Run isolated demo validation when needed**:
   - Assign a stable spike ID (`SPK-###`) and create the smallest runnable spike under `SPIKES_DIR` when docs and repository evidence cannot prove feasibility.
   - Keep the spike intentionally disposable: no production imports unless read-only, no edits outside `FEATURE_DIR/research-spikes/`, no migration or test-suite changes.
   - Define the spike before writing it:
     - hypothesis
     - inputs / fixture data
     - setup/env
     - expected pass condition
     - commands to run
     - actual result capture format
     - cleanup or non-persistence note
     - what this does not prove
   - Run the spike command if the local environment supports it.
   - Capture command, exit status, relevant output summary, and evidence path in `deep-research.md`.
   - If the environment cannot run the spike, record exactly what is missing and whether planning can still proceed with a manual-risk note.

9. **Synthesize research into planning decisions**:
   - Compare evidence packets across tracks.
   - Resolve conflicts and record why one source or demo result won over another.
   - Record every conflict and its resolution in the `Contradiction Resolution Log`.
   - Unresolved conflicts must be marked `BLOCKED` and escalated; do not hide them.
   - Identify the recommended approach, rejected approaches, and constraints `/sp.plan` must preserve.
   - Translate demo observations into planning implications rather than leaving them as raw logs.
   - Identify module boundaries, API/library choices, data flow notes, operational constraints, and validation implications that planning must account for.
   - Assign stable Planning Handoff IDs (`PH-###`) to each decision or constraint that `/sp.plan` must consume.

10. **Write `deep-research.md`**:
   Use `.specify/templates/examples/deep-research/` as the output-shape reference when available:
   - `not-needed.md` for `**Status**: Not needed`
   - `docs-only-evidence.md` when repository evidence and primary documentation are enough
   - `spike-required.md` when a disposable demo proves the implementation chain

   Use the lightweight structure below only when the gate is not needed:

   ```markdown

   - **Path**: `research-spikes/[name]`
   - **Command**: `[command]`

     - [option] -> [evidence-based reason and evidence IDs]
   - **Conflict resolution**:
     - [conflict] -> [resolution and evidence priority]
   - **Plan constraints**:
     - PH-### -> [constraint `/sp.plan` must preserve]

   ## Contradiction Resolution Log

   When two or more evidence items produce conflicting findings, record the
   resolution. Unresolved contradictions must be marked `BLOCKED` and escalated.

   | Conflict | Evidence A | Evidence B | Resolution | Priority Basis | Suppressed Reason |
   |----------|-----------|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
   | [e.g. API version] | EVD-002: v3 | EVD-005: v2 | v3 accepted | spike > docs | EVD-005 was outdated |
   | [unresolved] | EVD-007: pattern A | SPK-003: pattern B | **BLOCKED** | — | Contradictory runnable evidence |

   ## Planning Handoff

   - **Handoff IDs**: PH-001, PH-002, ...
   - **Recommended approach**: PH-001 -> [implementation direction `/sp.plan` should start from; trace to CAP/TRK/EVD/SPK IDs]
   - **Architecture implications**: PH-002 -> [components, layering, boundaries, sequencing; trace to CAP/TRK/EVD/SPK IDs]
   - **Module boundaries**: PH-003 -> [owners and interfaces to preserve; trace to CAP/TRK/EVD/SPK IDs]
   - **API / library choices**: PH-004 -> [selected APIs/libraries and why; trace to CAP/TRK/EVD/SPK IDs]
   - **Data flow notes**: PH-005 -> [inputs, state, outputs, side effects; trace to CAP/TRK/EVD/SPK IDs]
   - **Demo artifacts to reference**: PH-006 -> [`research-spikes/...` and command result; trace to SPK IDs]
   - **Constraints `/sp.plan` must preserve**:
     - PH-### -> [constraint; trace to CAP/TRK/EVD/SPK IDs]
   - **Validation implications**: PH-### -> [tests/checks the plan should include later; trace to CAP/TRK/EVD/SPK IDs]
   - **Residual risks requiring design mitigation**:
     - PH-### -> [risk; trace to CAP/TRK/EVD/SPK IDs]
   - **Decisions already proven by research**:
     - PH-### -> [decision; trace to CAP/TRK/EVD/SPK IDs]

   - **PH consumption contract**:
     - `mandatory` — `/sp.plan` must consume this PH; omitting it is a plan error.
     - `optional` — `/sp.plan` may defer if the plan does not need it.
     - `user-decision` — `/sp.plan` must ask the user before consuming or deferring.

     Each PH item in the Traceability Index must carry its consumption contract in
     the `Mandatory?` column.

   ## Capability Cards

   For each high-value or planning-critical capability, emit a capability card:

   ### CAP-001: [Capability Name]

   | Field | Detail |
   |-------|--------|
   | **Purpose** | [What this capability achieves] |
   | **Owner** | [Owning module / service / surface] |
   | **Truth lives** | [Code path, data table, config, or external service] |
   | **Entry points** | [CLI command, API route, event handler, hook] |
   | **Downstream consumers** | [What depends on this capability] |
   | **Extend here** | [Safe extension points] |
   | **Do not extend here** | [Fragile or contract-locked areas] |
   | **Key contracts** | [Input shape, output shape, side effects, invariants] |
   | **Change propagation** | [What breaks when this changes] |
   | **Minimum verification** | [Command or check that proves this works] |
   | **Failure modes** | [Known ways this can fail] |
   | **Confidence** | [Verified / Inferred / Unknown-Stale] |

   ## Research Exclusions

   Areas, surfaces, or dimensions intentionally not researched in this pass.

   | Excluded Area | Reason | Revisit Condition | Recorded By |
   |---------------|--------|-------------------|-------------|
   | [e.g. performance profiling] | [Not in feature scope] | [Before production deploy] | [Coordinator / TRK-###] |

   Every unverified dimension from the preset research checklist that was marked
   "not applicable" or "deferred" must appear here with a revisit condition.

   ## Planning Traceability Index

   | PH ID | CAP ID | TRK ID | Evidence IDs | Evidence Quality | Plan Consumer | Required Plan Action | Mandatory? |
   |-------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------------|------------|

   ## Next Command

   - [`/sp.plan` | `/sp.clarify` | stop with blocker]
   ```

11. **Update upstream artifacts when research changes planning readiness**:
   - Update `alignment.md`:
     - add feasibility result, capability status, implementation-chain confidence, Planning Handoff readiness, and Planning Gate Recommendation
     - recommend `/sp.deep-research` only when more feasibility work remains
     - recommend `/sp.plan` only when every planning-critical capability is proven, constrained enough, not needed, or explicitly force-accepted
   - Update `context.md`:
     - add implementation-chain evidence, Planning Handoff summary, spike paths, external constraints, rejected options, and residual risks that `/sp.plan` must preserve
   - Update `references.md`:
     - add external sources and reusable insights

12. **Run an artifact review gate**:
    - Review `deep-research.md`, `alignment.md`, and `context.md` for:
      - unproven capability chains presented as facts
      - demos with no pass condition
      - source claims without source attribution
      - subagent findings copied without coordinator synthesis
      - missing or vague research orchestration strategy when multiple tracks were available
      - missing `Planning Handoff` decisions for capabilities that affect plan structure
      - production-code edits from the research phase
      - feasibility risks not reflected in the Planning Gate Recommendation
    - If issues remain, revise the artifacts before handoff.

12b. **Run reverse coverage validation**:
    - Prove every CAP has at least one PH-ID.
    - Prove every PH-ID traces back to at least one evidence item (`EVD-###`, `SPK-###`, or live repository path).
    - Prove every `proven` CAP has no remaining unresolved unknown links.
    - Prove every `blocked` CAP has a concrete block reason and next action.
    - Prove every accepted evidence packet was consumed by at least one PH or explicitly deferred.
    - If any check fails, refuse handoff and write gaps back to `workflow-state.md`.

    ```markdown
    ## Reverse Coverage Validation

    | CAP ID | Has PH? | PH IDs | Has Evidence? | Evidence IDs | Proven / Clean? |
    |--------|---------|--------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|
    | CAP-001 | PASS | PH-001, PH-002 | PASS | EVD-001, SPK-001 | PASS |
    | CAP-002 | FAIL | — | — | — | FAIL: No PH assigned |

    **Decision**: [PASS / FAIL — if FAIL, refuse handoff]
    ```

13. **Write or update `WORKFLOW_STATE_FILE`**:
    - Record:
      - `active_command: sp-deep-research`
      - `phase_mode: research-only`
      - current authoritative files
      - exit criteria for feasibility completion
      - next action required before handoff
      - `next_command` as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.clarify`, or `/sp.deep-research`

14. **Report completion**:
    - branch or feature directory
    - deep-research artifact path
    - spike paths and command results, if any
    - research tracks and subagent evidence packet summary, if any
    - proven capabilities
    - constrained or blocked capabilities
    - Planning Handoff summary for `/sp.plan`
    - updated alignment/context/reference paths
    - recommended next command
    - whether the feature is ready for `/sp.plan`
    - [AGENT] before final completion text, if auto-capture did not preserve a reusable `workflow_gap`, `project_constraint`, or `decision_debt`, use the manual `learning capture` helper surface.
      Required options: `--command`, `--type`, `--summary`, `--evidence`
    - Use the user's current language for explanatory text while preserving literal command names, file paths, and fixed status values exactly as written.

## Readiness Refusal Rules

Before writing final `deep-research.md` and recommending `/sp.plan`, run every
check below. If **any** check fails, refuse handoff, produce a gap report, and
set `next_command` to `/sp.clarify` or mark the phase as blocked.

- [ ] Every CAP has at least one PH-ID assigned
- [ ] Every PH-ID traces to at least one evidence ID (`EVD-###`, `SPK-###`, or live repository path)
- [ ] No CAP remains `blocked` without an explicit user force-accept recorded in `alignment.md`
- [ ] No `proven` CAP still has unresolved unknown links in its implementation chain
- [ ] Every dispatched subagent returned an accepted evidence packet; rejected packets were retried or escalated
- [ ] `dispatch_shape: subagent-blocked` is recorded with a concrete block reason and escalation path
- [ ] Every spike with a defined hypothesis was run and has a captured pass/fail result

When refusal happens, output a gap report inline before the refusal decision:

```markdown
## Readiness Refusal Report

| Check | Status | Affected IDs | Missing / Reason |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| All CAPs have PH | FAIL | CAP-003 | No PH assigned |
| All PHs trace to evidence | FAIL | PH-005 | No EVD/SPK/repo path |
| ... | PASS | — | — |

**Decision**: Handoff refused. Next command: `/sp.clarify`
```

## Rules

- Use this command to produce research evidence and a planning handoff, not to design the full architecture.
- Prefer a small, runnable proof over broad speculative prose when the question is "can this work?"
- Disposable demos, research spikes, and proof artifacts validate feasibility for the user's intended capability. They are not a replacement product scope and must not be reframed as the delivered product unless the user explicitly confirms that reduced scope.
- Do not require this command for existing capability tweaks where the repository already shows the path.
- Do not advance to `/sp.plan` when a required capability is still `blocked` or `not viable` unless the user explicitly accepts a redesign or force-proceed risk.
- Keep all prototype work isolated under `FEATURE_DIR/research-spikes/`.
- Do not edit source code, tests, migrations, or production config from this command.
- Do not hand off to `/sp.plan` with only raw research notes; synthesize findings into `Planning Handoff`, constraints, rejected options, and residual risks.
- If this workflow makes actual source/runtime/template/config/test/generated-asset changes in the current run, follow the shared inline closeout contract:

### Inline Project Cognition Update

Workflow-owned mutation closeout is not an external map-maintenance handoff and is not external map maintenance. It is the workflow-local form of `$sp-map-update`. If this workflow changed project-related source, runtime, templates, generated assets, config, tests, state contracts, shared surfaces, or behavior-bearing docs, closeout MUST run inline project cognition update for the workflow-owned changed paths and affected surfaces before claiming clean completion.

Call the planner first:

```text
C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe closeout-plan --workflow '"$ACTIVE_WORKFLOW"' --format json
```

When `DELTA_SESSION_ID` exists, pass it into the planner:

```text
C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe closeout-plan --workflow '"$ACTIVE_WORKFLOW"' --delta-session '"$DELTA_SESSION_ID"' --format json
```

Consume `workflow_canonical`, `update_mode`, `payload_draft`, `required_agent_fields`, `unknown_paths`, `unknown_path_dispositions`, `delta_append_draft`, display-only `delta_append_command`, `update_argv`, display-only `update_command`, and `recommended_next_command`.

Before running `update`, fill the fields listed in `required_agent_fields` from live evidence from this workflow. Supported agent-owned evidence fields include:

- `verification`
- `behavior_surfaces`
- `generated_surfaces`
- `state_contracts`
- `known_unknowns`
- `confidence_notes`
- `user_decisions`
- `boundary`

If a field appears in `required_agent_fields`, provide live-evidence-backed content for it. Fields not listed by `required_agent_fields`, such as `known_unknowns` and `boundary`, are populated only when live evidence supports them; do not invent them to satisfy the shape.
Use `known_unknowns` only for blockers that make the cognition update unsafe to trust. If the working tree contains unrelated dirty/untracked paths and the workflow uses explicit workflow-owned paths, record that as `confidence_notes` or `boundary.initial_dirty_paths`, not as a blocking `known_unknowns` item.

For each `unknown_path_dispositions[]` item, set `agent_disposition` to exactly one allowed value:

- `adoptable`: verified new path inside this workflow-owned scope; it may be recorded in changed/scope paths and verified adoptable paths do not become blocking `known_unknowns`.
- `review_only`: path informed review but is not adopted into changed coverage.
- `ignored`: path remains excluded and must not enter payloads, records, route indexes, evidence, aliases, or minimal live reads.
- `blocking_known_unknown`: record it as a known unknown and report partial or blocked cognition closeout.

`agent_disposition=adoptable` is an agent accounting decision, not proof that runtime indexing already succeeded. Runtime adoption still requires a usable active project-cognition DB, at least one passing verification evidence item, and no blocking `known_unknowns`. After `update_argv` runs, inspect `result_state`, `adopted_paths`, `review_paths`, `minimal_live_reads`, and `partial_refresh_reasons`; do not explain a remaining `partial_refresh` as "path_index missing" until those fields show which adoption gate failed.

If `update_mode=delta_session`, complete `delta_append_draft.argv_prefix` with agent-owned repeatable flags such as `--behavior-surface`, `--generated-surface`, `--verification`, and accepted `--known-unknown` values from `delta_append_draft.argv_placeholders`. Then append the delta event and run `update_argv`. `delta_append_command` and `update_command` are display-only placeholders, not execution strings.

If `update_mode=payload_file`, write the completed `payload_draft` to the planner's `payload_path`. Then run `update_argv`. `update_command` is a display-only placeholder, not an execution string.

Completed payload drafts preserve the planner-owned `changed_paths` and `scope_paths` and add agent-owned evidence fields before recording.

Structured `update` invalidates related claims and returns their stable IDs in `affected_graph_claims`. This is separate from update readiness: generic workflow verification and `result_state=ready` must not re-promote stale or contradicted graph claims. Only when this workflow already has decisive claim-specific bounded live evidence for an exact returned claim ID may it submit semantic reconciliation intent and run:

```text
C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe claim-reconcile prepare --input '<intent.json>' --format json
C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe claim-reconcile apply --input '<prepared_packet_path>' --format json
```

Provide only reconciliation intent: workflow, stable `claim_id`, reason, and evidence containing repository-relative `source_path`, bounded line `span`, and `supporting` or `contradicting` role. Add verification only when it is claim-specific. The runtime owns the contract version, active generation, expected state and revision, UTC observation and expiry, source kind, content hashes, repository snapshot, IDs, and prepared packet path. Do not author or edit those integrity fields; execute the returned `apply_argv` exactly. If no such evidence exists, leave the claim stale. If reconciliation returns ready, rerun Compass once so later routing consumes the current evidence basis; partial or blocked reconciliation remains withheld and follows `recommended_next_action`.

For compatibility with worker handoffs and delta packets, the runtime also accepts `verification_evidence` as an alias for `verification` and `generated_surface_notes` as an alias for `generated_surfaces`. Verification evidence may be an array of objects (`command`, `result`, `artifact`) or an array of command-result strings, but clean closeout still requires passing verification evidence; failed verification cannot produce a clean `ready` closeout.

Clean closeout keys on `result_state`, not `status=ok`, `update_id`, `last_update_id`, or freshness alone:

- `ready` or `no_op`: project cognition closeout may be clean when ordinary verification also passed.
- `partial_refresh`: useful update data was written, but the final workflow state must report partial cognition closeout, `partial_refresh_reasons`, and the returned `minimal_live_reads`. If `partial_refresh_reasons` includes `missing_passing_verification_result`, repair the payload or delta evidence and rerun `update_argv` before final closeout; do not route that to `sp-map-update`. If verified workflow-owned paths still remain in `review_paths` after the update, report implementation completion separately from project-cognition maintenance and name `$sp-map-update` as follow-up repair.
- `needs_rebuild`: report the exact rebuild condition and route to `$sp-map-scan`, then `$sp-map-build`.
- `blocked`: report the runtime or validation blocker and the exact recovery command.
- `recorded`: legacy recorded-only output; treat it as partial or blocked, never as clean completion.

Never run the `complete-refresh` or `clear-dirty` helper after `result_state=partial_refresh`, `needs_rebuild`, `blocked`, or legacy `recorded`; those helpers are only for states that the runtime and validation prove ready.

Dirty fallback command shape: `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe mark-dirty --reason '"<reason>"' --format json`.
Use `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe mark-dirty --reason '"workflow-closeout-failed"' --format json` only when inline update cannot complete: when the planner or update command is unavailable, cannot record useful update data, cannot identify workflow-owned scope, or cannot be trusted because verification/workflow completion is not trustworthy. Dirty only when inline update cannot complete.

sp-map-update is for manual/external maintenance and follow-up repair. `$sp-map-update` remains the external/manual workflow for user edits, interrupted workflow repair, explicit map maintenance, and follow-up repair. It is not routine cleanup for changes this workflow just made. If `sp-map-update` already ran `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe update --reason map-update` for the same changed paths, do not run a second `workflow-finalize` closeout update for those paths.

## Post-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (after deep research)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_deep_research` key.
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable.
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation.
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently.

## Codex Subagent Capability Discovery

- Execution model: preserve the workflow's existing `subagent-mandatory`, `subagents-first`, `adaptive`, or `subagent-assisted` policy.
- Dispatch shape: preserve the workflow's existing dispatch shape; use `subagent-blocked` only after the discovery step below fails or is unsafe.
- Execution surface: prefer `native-subagents` when the current runtime supports it; use `none` only after recording the unavailable or unsafe surface.
- Native subagent capability discovery: Before recording `subagent-blocked`, confirm the current runtime exposes `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, and `close_agent`; if they are not visible, use the active tool discovery mechanism for multi-agent or subagent tools first.
- Do not record `subagent-blocked` until this capability discovery step is complete and the exact unavailable or unsafe surface is recorded.
- Native subagent dispatch: Dispatch bounded subagents through `spawn_agent`.
- Join behavior: Rejoin with `wait_agent`, integrate, then `close_agent`.
- Preserve this workflow's existing packet, handoff, artifact, and result schema; this section only governs capability discovery before dispatch or blocked-state recording.

## Codex Structured Question Preference

- If this command was routed by `sp-auto` with `auto_default_recommendation: true`, evaluate the automatic recommended/default continuation gate before any question path.
- When that gate has one safe recommended/default answer, you must auto-resolve the question or confirmation, record the accepted recommendation in the workflow state or summary, continue the workflow, and do not invoke the native structured question tool only to ask for that approval.
- If the automatic gate is not safe, write the blocker and self-unblock recommendation before using the normal question path.
- If the runtime's native structured question tool is available for the current turn and the `sp-auto` automatic gate did not resolve the question, you must use it.
- Do not render the textual fallback block when the native tool is available.
- Do not self-authorize textual fallback because the question seems simple, short, or easy to phrase manually.
- Treat the template's textual question format as fallback-only guidance; use it to shape the question content, but do not render the textual block unless the native tool is unavailable in the current runtime or the tool call fails.
- Keep native-tool availability, runtime mode, and fallback mechanics backstage. Do not tell the user that a structured question tool is unavailable, that the current runtime/mode lacks a tool, or that a fallback is being used; ask the user-facing question directly when a question is genuinely required.
- Ask only the minimum number of questions required by this workflow's existing contract.
- Keep the user-visible question text in the user's current language and keep option labels short.
- Do not emit both a native tool question and the textual fallback block in the same turn. The user should see the active question exactly once.
- If the native tool is unavailable in the current runtime or the tool call fails, ask one concise plain-text question about the missing feasibility or research-track decision, then continue with the existing research workflow.
- In `deep-research`, use this preference for:
  - whether the feasibility question is actually a requirement gap
  - minimum research tracks needed before planning
  - manual confirmation before force-proceeding with unresolved feasibility risk
- Native tool target: `request_user_input` if the current Codex runtime exposes it
- Question count: 1-3 short questions per call
- Option count: 2-3 options per question
- Required question fields: `header`, `id`, `question`, `options`
- Option fields: `label`, `description`
- Put the recommended option first and suffix its label with `(Recommended)` when that distinction matters.
- Use this native surface for one bounded clarification or selection step; if it is unavailable or too narrow for the needed interaction, fall back immediately to the template's textual question format.
