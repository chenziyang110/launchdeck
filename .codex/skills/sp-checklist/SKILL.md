## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `$sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



## Workflow Contract Summary

- **When to use**: You need a domain-specific checklist to inspect the quality of requirements or planning artifacts before execution.
- **Primary objective**: Generate a tailored checklist that acts like unit tests for the written requirements, not for the implementation.
- **Primary outputs**: A custom checklist aligned to the current feature, audience, and review depth.
- **Default handoff**: Apply the checklist to the relevant artifact set and then return to the planning workflow with any resulting gaps.
- **Execution note**: This summary is routing metadata only. Follow the full contract below end-to-end rather than inferring behavior from the description alone.

## Blocked Exit Contract

If blocked after safe recovery, read and follow
`.specify/templates/workflow-blocker-template.md` and its JSON schema. Never
return only an error or “ask a human”; preserve state and keep agent-capable
repair agent-owned. Set `human_action_required: true` only for authority,
credentials, protected systems, human decisions/reviews, or physical access.
Tailor steps, expected results, failure paths, evidence, and resume action to
CI, visual review, or product decisions. Never claim completion.

For a feature runtime blocker, do not invent `resume_argv` or overwrite an
existing blocker. The CLI returns a read-only `show_argv` and structured
`resolution_action`; `next_argv` stays empty while evidence is missing. After
the criteria are proven, attach sanitized evidence using the action's declared
input and execute its base argv. It restores the same owner and keeps the full
blocker audit.

## Checklist Purpose: "Unit Tests for English"

**CRITICAL CONCEPT**: Checklists are **UNIT TESTS FOR REQUIREMENTS WRITING** - they validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of requirements in a given domain.

**NOT for verification/testing**:

- ❌ NOT "Verify the button clicks correctly"
- ❌ NOT "Test error handling works"
- ❌ NOT "Confirm the API returns 200"
- ❌ NOT checking if code/implementation matches the spec

**FOR requirements quality validation**:

- ✅ "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined for all card types?" (completeness)
- ✅ "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" (clarity)
- ✅ "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" (consistency)
- ✅ "Are accessibility requirements defined for keyboard navigation?" (coverage)
- ✅ "Does the spec define what happens when logo image fails to load?" (edge cases)

**Metaphor**: If your spec is code written in English, the checklist is its unit test suite. You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Objective

Generate a focused checklist that validates the quality, clarity, completeness, and review readiness of the current written requirements.

## Context

- Primary inputs: the user's requested checklist focus plus the current feature artifacts and any clarifying answers.
- The checklist is for requirements quality, not for verifying a working implementation.
- Audience and rigor level materially affect the resulting checklist and should be clarified when necessary.

## Process

- Load the current feature context and derive the likely checklist focus.
- Ask only the minimum clarification questions needed to shape the checklist.
- Generate the checklist around the relevant requirement-quality dimensions and review scenario.

## Output Contract

- Produce a tailored checklist that can be used to review the current requirement or planning artifact set.
- Make the checklist specific enough that reviewers can tell what is missing or underspecified.
- Keep it scoped to requirement quality rather than implementation behavior.

## Guardrails

- Do not turn the checklist into a code test plan.
- Do not ask redundant questions the current artifacts already answer clearly.
- Do not hallucinate risk domains that are not supported by the current request or artifacts.

## Mandatory Subagent Execution

All substantive tasks in ordinary `sp-*` workflows default to and must use subagents.

The leader orchestrates: route, split tasks, prepare task contracts, dispatch subagents, wait for structured handoffs, integrate results, verify, and update state.

Before dispatch, every subagent lane needs a task contract with objective, authoritative inputs, allowed read/write scope, forbidden paths, acceptance checks, verification evidence, and structured handoff format.

Use `execution_model: subagent-mandatory`.
Use `dispatch_shape: one-subagent | parallel-subagents`.
Use `execution_surface: native-subagents`.


## Project Learning

The CLI is the only agent-facing Learning read surface:

1. Run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify learning start --command '<classic-command-name>' --format json` before deeper non-trivial work.
2. Select summaries by applicability and triggers; use `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify learning list --command '<classic-command-name>' --format json` only to filter or page.
3. Execute one matching card's `show_argv`. Do not parse Learning storage.

After minimal live inspection identifies a reused operation or changed entry point, rerun targeted recall with current code, tests, and task/contract evidence, for example `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify learning list --command '<classic-command-name>' --context 'operation_owner=<owner>' --context 'consumer_owner=<consumer>' --context 'outcome=<result-family>' --format json`. Do not derive these facets from archived specifications. An exact operation-owner match may surface a cross-command candidate even when the new consumer differs; treat it as a candidate, expand one `show_argv`, verify it against live evidence, and do not auto-apply it.

When the entrypoint outcome audit is triggered, persist the live facets as `learning_context`, the contextual invocation as `learning_search_refs`, and returned refs as `learning_candidate_refs`. Record exactly one `applied`, `not_applicable`, or `deferred` item in `learning_dispositions` for every candidate. Do not silently ignore a candidate: applied Learning traces to requirement/consequence refs, not-applicable needs current evidence, and deferred needs an explicit deferral ref.

`start`, `list`, and `show` are read-only. Current repository evidence,
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and explicit user direction override stale or
candidate Learning.

At closeout, corrections, retries, route changes, recovery, false leads, hidden
dependencies, validation/tooling/state/cognition gaps, constraints, and near
misses are capture signals. Prefer `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify learning capture-auto`
from owning state; manual capture includes summary, problem, action, triggers,
success criteria, avoid items, exceptions, and evidence.

- `fast`: skip unless the task escalates.
- `accept`, `analyze`, `ask`, `auto`, `constitution`, `explain`,
  `implement-teams`, `taskstoissues`, and `team`: consume-only; do not violate
  their write boundaries to capture.
- Other non-trivial workflows: consume before deeper work; capture reusable
  signals at closeout or record a no-learning decision.

The `policy` returned by the CLI is authoritative when prompt wording drifts.

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.
   - All file paths must be absolute.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Query brownfield navigation context before shaping the checklist**
   - [AGENT] Run or emulate `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe compass --intent plan '--query="$ARGUMENTS"' --format json`. Read top-level `minimal_live_reads` first, then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons, `verification_hints`, `followup_surfaces`, and `before_fix_claim`. Treat `coverage_diagnostics` as confidence and closeout signals, do not infer final edit scope from first-pass reads, and use `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe expand` only when the packet's coverage state or live evidence requires it.
   - [AGENT] Preserve the advanced `lexicon -> semantic_intake -> query` flow for explicit concept decisions or unresolved coverage. In that escalation, write `semantic_intake` from the alias catalog, select candidates by facet coverage, write `concept_decisions` with `covered_facets`, `missing_facets`, and `match_sources`, carry `lexicon_generation_id`, add `repository_search_terms`, then run `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe query --intent plan --query-plan '"<query_plan_json>"' --format json`. Agent-owned semantic normalization is mandatory: raw lexicon ranking and `agent_normalization` are only bootstrap signals, not route decisions. If `agent_normalization.required=true`, every raw candidate is `score=0`, or the prompt is localized, mixed-language, CJK, colloquial, or symptom-first, extract embedded project terms and write `semantic_intake` from the alias catalog before selecting or rejecting concepts. If `agent_normalization` is omitted, treat it as `required=false`; CJK or mixed CJK/ASCII input still requires agent normalization even when positive raw lexical matches exist because embedded project tokens do not translate the surrounding user language. The agent still owns translation; `agent_normalization` is advisory guidance, not a route decision. This includes mixed-language or CJK text. (raw lexicon ranking is only a bootstrap; action: write_semantic_intake_from_alias_catalog) Derive project-language search terms from the alias catalog before source search. Do not search only the raw user words; include component names, state names, file names, command names, UI labels, and route names from candidates, aliases, matched_terms, colloquial_matches, returned paths, `normalized_query`, and `expanded_queries`. Use these project-language search terms before broad repository search.
   - [AGENT] Readiness values are `query_ready`, `review`, `needs_rebuild`, `blocked`, and `unsupported_runtime`. Use the returned readiness:
     - `query_ready`: read top-level `minimal_live_reads` first, then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons.
     - `review`: perform only the returned `minimal_live_reads` before continuing and inspect `coverage_diagnostics`.
     - `needs_rebuild`: route by `recommended_next_action.action_id`, not readiness alone. Preserve resumable actions such as `complete_scan_packets`; only `action_id=project_cognition.rebuild` may consume `rebuild_reasons[]` and `recommended_next_action.workflow_routes.classic.steps` as a rebuild handoff.
     - `blocked`: report the blocking runtime issue and continue with live evidence only where this workflow allows degraded navigation.
     - `unsupported_runtime`: continue with live evidence and record that compass intake was unavailable.
   - Treat this as a coverage-model check, not a file-presence check. If the returned task-local bundle cannot identify the touched area's owning surfaces, change-propagation hotspots, verification entry points, or known unknowns, route through the returned `recommended_next_action`.

3. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:
   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks
   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content
   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Prefer precision over breadth

   Generation algorithm:
   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators ("critical", "must", "compliance"), stakeholder hints ("QA", "review", "security team"), and explicit deliverables ("a11y", "rollback", "contracts").
   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.
   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.
   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.
   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:
      - Scope refinement (e.g., "Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?")
      - Risk prioritization (e.g., "Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?")
      - Depth calibration (e.g., "Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?")
      - Audience framing (e.g., "Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?")
      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., "Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?")
      - Scenario class gap (e.g., "No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?")

   Question formatting rules:
   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters
   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer
   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said
   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: "Confirm whether X belongs in scope."

   Defaults when interaction impossible:
   - Depth: Standard
   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise
   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters

   When the runtime exposes a native structured question tool, use that native tool for these contextual questions and map the same Q1/Q2/Q3 or Q4/Q5 intent into the native tool fields instead of rendering the textual labels verbatim.
   Treat the textual Q1/Q2/Q3 and Q4/Q5 format as fallback-only guidance; the textual labels below apply only when no suitable native structured question tool is available.

   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., "Unresolved recovery path risk"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.

4. **Understand user request**: Combine `$ARGUMENTS` + clarifying answers:
   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)
   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user
   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding
   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks plus project cognition coverage (do NOT hallucinate)

5. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope
   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies
   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks
   - alignment.md or context.md when they materially change requirement interpretation
   - `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` when it exists and the new checklist must complement rather than duplicate the requirement-quality baseline

   **Context Loading Strategy**:
   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)
   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets
   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected
   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text
   - Use project cognition coverage to identify which requirement surfaces, interfaces, and scenario classes deserve review emphasis.

6. **Generate checklist** - Create "Unit Tests for Requirements":
   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Generate unique checklist filename:
     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)
     - Format: `[domain].md`
   - File handling behavior:
     - If file does NOT exist: Create new file and number items starting from CHK001
     - If file exists: Append new items to existing file, continuing from the last CHK ID (e.g., if last item is CHK015, start new items at CHK016)
   - Never delete or replace existing checklist content - always preserve and append

   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:
   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:
   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?
   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?
   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?
   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?
   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?

   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:
   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)
   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)
   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)
   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)
   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)
   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)
   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)
   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)
   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)

   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - "Unit Tests for English"**:

   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):
   - "Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards"
   - "Test hover states work on desktop"
   - "Confirm logo click navigates home"

   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):
   - "Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?" [Completeness]
   - "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" [Clarity]
   - "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" [Consistency]
   - "Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?" [Coverage]
   - "Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?" [Edge Cases]
   - "Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?" [Completeness]
   - "Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?" [Clarity]

   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:
   Each item should follow this pattern:
   - Question format asking about requirement quality
   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan
   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]
   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements
   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements

   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:

   Completeness:
   - "Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]"
   - "Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]"
   - "Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]"

   Clarity:
   - "Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]"
   - "Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]"
   - "Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]"

   Consistency:
   - "Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]"
   - "Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]"

   Coverage:
   - "Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]"
   - "Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]"
   - "Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]"

   Measurability:
   - "Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]"
   - "Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]"

   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):
   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios
   - For each scenario class, ask: "Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?"
   - If scenario class missing: "Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]"
   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: "Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]"

   **Traceability Requirements**:
   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference
   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`
   - If no ID system exists: "Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]"

   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):
   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:
   - Ambiguities: "Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]"
   - Conflicts: "Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]"
   - Assumptions: "Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]"
   - Dependencies: "Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]"
   - Missing definitions: "Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]"

   **Content Consolidation**:
   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact
   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect
   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: "Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]"

   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:
   - ❌ Any item starting with "Verify", "Test", "Confirm", "Check" + implementation behavior
   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior
   - ❌ "Displays correctly", "works properly", "functions as expected"
   - ❌ "Click", "navigate", "render", "load", "execute"
   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures
   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)

   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:
   - ✅ "Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?"
   - ✅ "Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?"
   - ✅ "Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?"
   - ✅ "Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?"
   - ✅ "Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?"
   - ✅ "Does the spec define [missing aspect]?"

7. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.

8. **Report**: Output full path to checklist file, item count, and summarize whether the run created a new file or appended to an existing one. Summarize:
   - Focus areas selected
   - Depth level
   - Actor/timing
   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated
   - Recommended next workflow:
     - If the checklist reveals planning-critical requirement gaps, contradictory behavior, or missing acceptance criteria, recommend `/sp-specify` (or `/sp-clarify` when the spec package already exists and only needs deeper analysis).
     - If the checklist reveals a clear requirement whose implementation chain is still unproven, recommend `/sp-deep-research` before `/sp-plan`.
     - If the checklist exposes plan-shaping technical or artifact completeness gaps, recommend `/sp-plan`.
     - If the checklist is materially satisfied and execution preparation should continue, recommend `/sp-tasks` so task generation can perform its built-in implementation-readiness gate.

**Important**: Each `/sp.checklist` command invocation uses a short, descriptive checklist filename and either creates a new file or appends to an existing one. This allows:

- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)
- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose
- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder

To avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.

## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items

**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`

## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do

**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**

```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]
```

**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**

```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 - Can "visual hierarchy" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]
```

**Key Differences:**

- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly
- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly
- Wrong: Verification of behavior
- Correct: Validation of requirement quality
- Wrong: "Does it do X?"
- Correct: "Is X clearly specified?"

## Codex Subagent Capability Discovery

- Execution model: preserve the workflow's existing `subagent-mandatory`, `subagents-first`, `adaptive`, or `subagent-assisted` policy.
- Dispatch shape: preserve the workflow's existing dispatch shape; use `subagent-blocked` only after the discovery step below fails or is unsafe.
- Execution surface: prefer `native-subagents` when the current runtime supports it; use `none` only after recording the unavailable or unsafe surface.
- Native subagent capability discovery: Before recording `subagent-blocked`, confirm the current runtime exposes `spawn_agent`, `wait_agent`, and `close_agent`; if they are not visible, use the active tool discovery mechanism for multi-agent or subagent tools first.
- Do not record `subagent-blocked` until this capability discovery step is complete and the exact unavailable or unsafe surface is recorded.
- Native subagent dispatch: Dispatch bounded subagents through `spawn_agent`.
- Join behavior: Rejoin with `wait_agent`, integrate, then `close_agent`.
- Preserve this workflow's existing packet, handoff, artifact, and result schema; this section only governs capability discovery before dispatch or blocked-state recording.

## Codex Structured Question Preference

- If this command was routed by `sp-auto` with `auto_default_recommendation: true`, evaluate the automatic recommended/default continuation gate before any question path.
- When that gate has one safe recommended/default answer, you must auto-resolve the question or confirmation, record the accepted recommendation in the workflow state or summary, continue the workflow, and do not invoke the native structured question tool only to ask for that approval.
- If the automatic gate is not safe, write the blocker and self-unblock recommendation before using the normal question path.
- If the runtime's native structured question tool is available for the current turn and the `sp-auto` automatic gate did not resolve the question, you must use it.
- Do not render the textual fallback block when the native tool is available.
- Do not self-authorize textual fallback because the question seems simple, short, or easy to phrase manually.
- Treat the template's textual question format as fallback-only guidance; use it to shape the question content, but do not render the textual block unless the native tool is unavailable in the current runtime or the tool call fails.
- Keep native-tool availability, runtime mode, and fallback mechanics backstage. Do not tell the user that a structured question tool is unavailable, that the current runtime/mode lacks a tool, or that a fallback is being used; ask the user-facing question directly when a question is genuinely required.
- Ask only the minimum number of questions required by this workflow's existing contract.
- Keep the user-visible question text in the user's current language and keep option labels short.
- Do not emit both a native tool question and the textual fallback block in the same turn. The user should see the active question exactly once.
- If the native tool is unavailable in the current runtime or the tool call fails, keep the template's existing `Q1`/`Q2`/`Q3` (and optional `Q4`/`Q5`) textual question format.
- In `checklist`, use this preference for:
  - initial contextual clarifying questions (`Q1`-`Q3`)
  - optional targeted follow-ups (`Q4`-`Q5`) when high-value gaps remain
- Native tool target: `request_user_input` if the current Codex runtime exposes it
- Question count: 1-3 short questions per call
- Option count: 2-3 options per question
- Required question fields: `header`, `id`, `question`, `options`
- Option fields: `label`, `description`
- Put the recommended option first and suffix its label with `(Recommended)` when that distinction matters.
- Use this native surface for one bounded clarification or selection step; if it is unavailable or too narrow for the needed interaction, fall back immediately to the template's textual question format.

## Checklist Project Cognition Intake

- Run `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe compass --intent plan '--query="$ARGUMENTS"' --format json` before shaping the checklist. Read top-level `minimal_live_reads` first, then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons, `verification_hints`, `followup_surfaces`, and `before_fix_claim`; treat `coverage_diagnostics` as confidence and closeout signals and `expansion_ref` as a continuation path only when coverage state or live evidence requires it.
- Preserve the advanced `lexicon -> semantic_intake -> query` path with `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe query --intent plan --query-plan '"<query_plan_json>"' --format json` when explicit concept decisions are needed; include `query_plan`, `semantic_intake`, `concept_decisions`, `covered_facets`, `missing_facets`, `match_sources`, `lexicon_generation_id`, and `repository_search_terms` there.
