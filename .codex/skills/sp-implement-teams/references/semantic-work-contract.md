## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `$sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.


Trigger: when project-cognition-backed semantic intake, routing, permission, audit, resume, or final-claim rules affect the implement-teams workflow.

Purpose: Preserve the shared semantic mediation and semantic-audit contract outside the implement-teams main-flow prompt.

Preserved Contract: Semantic intake, bounded inspection, verification-owner discovery, workflow authorization, resume validation, and final-claim readiness rules remain mandatory when applicable.

## Project Cognition Advisory Gate

This command should treat the project cognition runtime as an advisory navigation index, not a mandatory pre-source gate.

### Advisory Rule

Use project cognition when available to find likely owners, affected paths,
risks, verification routes, and minimal live reads. Do not treat map output as
evidence by itself. Technical claims must be backed by live code, tests,
scripts, configuration, or authoritative docs.

Archived specifications are excluded from default discovery and are never
current authority. Read one only when explicit lineage or provenance is needed,
name the exact historical claim being traced, and verify it against current live evidence
before use. A conflicting archive cannot override the live repository,
an active approved contract, or confirmed user direction.

### Required Project Cognition Compass

Default project cognition intake is `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe compass --intent '<intent>' '--query="$ARGUMENTS"' --format json`.

Consume the packet in this order:

1. Read top-level `epistemic_contract` first. Require `graph_role=route_candidate_only`, `fact_source_of_truth=live_repository`, `live_verification_required=true`, `graph_only_claims_allowed=false`, and `unverified_claim_action=withhold`.
2. Read top-level `minimal_live_reads` and use those files as the bounded first live evidence route.
3. Then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` for reasons, evidence hints, verification hints, follow-up surfaces, and `before_fix_claim` checks.
4. Read lane-level `claim_refs` only as compact route candidates. `route_confidence` is scoped by `confidence_scope=route_candidate`; inspect each claim's `state`, `freshness`, and `stale` marker, and require live verification before using it as repository truth.
5. Treat `coverage_diagnostics` as confidence and closeout signals, never as route candidates.
6. Treat `expansion_ref` as a normal continuation path. Run `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe expand --id '<id>' --section claim_evidence --format json` when an active claim needs its bounded `source_path`/`span` evidence; use other sections only when coverage state or live evidence requires more map detail. Advanced `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe query` may also return top-level `claim_signals` with bounded evidence refs.
7. Do not infer final edit scope from `minimal_live_reads`, `first_pass_paths`, `claim_refs`, `claim_signals`, or `claim_evidence`.

Compass applies graph claims only as a bounded rerank after repository-backed route eligibility is established. `match_score` remains the eligibility score; lane `claim_ranking.adjustment` may only move an already-matched candidate by `+1` for fresh `supported`/`verified_in_graph_generation`, `-1` for stale, or `-2` for contradicted. Claims cannot create candidates and cannot replace live verification. When `coverage_diagnostics` contains `stale_claim_signal` or `contradicted_claim_signal`, treat the packet as `usable_with_review`, follow `reconcile_claims_with_minimal_live_reads`, and complete the lane-specific refresh or reconciliation action against the live repository.

For a selected stale or contradicted claim, open only the returned claim-specific bounded live reads. If those reads are decisive, provide only reconciliation intent: workflow, stable `claim_id`, reason, and evidence with repository-relative `source_path`, bounded line `span`, and `supporting` or `contradicting` role, plus optional claim-specific verification. Run `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe claim-reconcile prepare --input '<intent.json>' --format json`. The runtime owns the contract version, active generation, expected state and revision, UTC observation and expiry, source kind, file hashes, repository snapshot, IDs, and prepared packet path; do not author or edit those integrity fields. Execute the returned `apply_argv` exactly; it invokes `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe claim-reconcile apply --input '<prepared_packet_path>' --format json`. A generic workflow verification is insufficient. On `result_state=ready`, rerun Compass once and use the new packet only for routing; on partial or blocked output, withhold the claim and follow `recommended_next_action`.

The `epistemic_contract` cannot authorize source changes and cannot prove current behavior. Carry `epistemic_contract` into downstream state, withhold unverified claims, and let contradictory live evidence override the route candidate.

Graph claims are indexed assertions. Their lifecycle is `candidate`, `supported`, `verified_in_graph_generation`, `contradicted`, or `stale`; even `verified_in_graph_generation` is only an active graph-generation state, not current repository truth. Graph claims cannot authorize source changes and cannot set workflow `claim_ready=true`; open bounded live evidence and run matching workflow claim-specific verification before any final claim.

Readiness values are `query_ready`, `review`, `needs_rebuild`, `blocked`, and `unsupported_runtime`. Compass-specific advice is in `compass_state` and the structured `recommended_next_action` object. Do not treat `recommended_next_action` as a string. Read `recommended_next_action.action_id` for every packet. Non-rebuild actions omit `recommended_next_action.workflow_routes` and are selected by `action_id` alone.

- `query_ready`: read top-level `minimal_live_reads` first, then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons before expanding.
- `review`: inspect the returned `minimal_live_reads` before expanding and carry review notes from `coverage_diagnostics`.
- `needs_rebuild`: do not route from readiness alone; it can accompany a resumable action such as `complete_scan_packets`. Preserve non-rebuild `recommended_next_action.action_id` values. Only for `action_id=project_cognition.rebuild`, inspect every `rebuild_reasons[]` entry, consume `recommended_next_action.workflow_routes.classic.steps`, and project those steps through this integration's invocation syntax. Reserve `$sp-map-scan -> $sp-map-build` for that structured route; do not infer cause or route from readiness or a legacy action string.
- `blocked`: report the runtime state clearly; continue with live evidence only when this workflow allows degraded advisory navigation.
- `unsupported_runtime`: continue with live evidence and record that compass intake was unavailable.

If a non-workflow action includes `recommended_next_action.argv`, execute that exact argv through the project-pinned cognition launcher. `project_cognition.repair_status` owns deterministic status reconstruction after the graph store validates; never patch graph metadata by hand.

When `compass_state=needs_semantic_intake`, the agent writes `semantic_intake` from project vocabulary and reruns compass with `--semantic-intake-file`, or uses the advanced `lexicon -> semantic_intake -> query` path when explicit concept decisions are needed.

### Advanced Routing

Advanced routing remains available as `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe lexicon --mode catalog`, agent-authored `semantic_intake` and `concept_decisions`, then `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe query --query-plan`. Use it when the first compass packet is too draft-like, a workflow needs explicit concept decisions, or coverage cannot be resolved from the default packet.

The advanced `lexicon -> semantic_intake -> query` path retrieves the schema v5 `alias_index`-backed alias catalog, helps agents normalize user input into project vocabulary, records `alias_interpretations`, selects task-relevant `selected_concepts`, records unsafe or irrelevant `rejected_concepts`, writes per-concept `concept_decisions`, carries `lexicon_generation_id` and `candidate_universe_version`, and then runs `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe query --query-plan`. The current query contract is `claim_retrieval_contract_version=2` and `candidate_universe_version=2`. Never parse missing or non-current versions as legacy input; rerun lexicon or compass with the current binary and repair the install if needed. Schema v5 is current-only. The current runtime does not migrate schema v4 or older databases and does not archive or replace them. Remove the incompatible project-cognition.db explicitly, then run `sp-map-scan -> sp-map-build` with the current binary. When writing the recommendation in plain text, use: run sp-map-scan -> sp-map-build.

If `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe query` reports query-plan diagnostics, carry forward its `warnings`, `repair_hints`, normalized `query_plan`, structured `errors`, and `expected_shape` instead of reducing them to a raw parser exception.

### Agent-Owned Semantic Normalization

Agent-owned semantic normalization is mandatory for the advanced path. The raw lexicon ranking and `agent_normalization` are only bootstrap signals for retrieving the alias catalog and candidate universe; they are not route decisions. Raw lexicon ranking is only a bootstrap. Treat `agent_normalization.required=true` as a non-intelligent CLI reminder to write `semantic_intake` from the alias catalog (action: write_semantic_intake_from_alias_catalog). If `agent_normalization` is omitted, `omitted => required=false`: treat it as `required=false`; omission does not make raw lexical ranking authoritative. If raw `concept_candidates` are all `score=0`, or the prompt is localized, mixed-language, CJK, colloquial, symptom-first, or mixed-language or CJK text, do not stop at the raw score. CJK or mixed CJK/ASCII input still requires agent normalization even when positive raw lexical matches exist because embedded project tokens do not translate the surrounding user language. Extract embedded project terms such as command names, UI labels, file stems, state names, adapter names, and skill or package identifiers from the user's wording and the alias catalog. The agent still owns translation; `agent_normalization` is advisory guidance, not a route decision. Put those translated terms into `normalized_query`, `alias_interpretations`, `intent_facets`, `expanded_queries`, and `repository_search_terms`, then select or reject concepts by facet coverage.

Use this canonical query-plan skeleton when shaping `<query_plan_json>`. Keep `alias_interpretations` as an array of objects, not strings:

```json
{
  "raw_query": "$ARGUMENTS",
  "candidate_universe_version": 2,
  "semantic_intake": {
    "workflow_intent": "<active workflow intent>",
    "normalized_query": "<project-language interpretation>",
    "intent_facets": ["<facet the selected concept must cover>"],
    "negative_constraints": ["<scope boundary not to treat as route truth>"],
    "alias_interpretations": [
      {"alias": "<user term>", "meaning": "<project term>", "confidence": "medium"}
    ],
    "open_semantic_questions": []
  },
  "selected_concepts": ["<concept id from lexicon payload>"],
  "rejected_concepts": ["<considered concept id>"],
  "concept_decisions": [
    {
      "concept_id": "<concept id>",
      "decision": "selected",
      "selection_reason": "<facet-coverage rationale>",
      "covered_facets": ["<covered facet>"],
      "missing_facets": [],
      "match_sources": ["alias", "semantic_intake"],
      "confidence": "medium",
      "risk": ""
    }
  ],
  "lexicon_generation_id": "<lexicon_generation_id from lexicon payload>",
  "expanded_queries": ["<normalized project-language query>"],
  "repository_search_terms": ["<project-local term to search before raw wording>"],
  "paths": ["<justified path hint>"]
}
```

### Project-Language Search Terms

Before any source search, turn the user's wording into project-language search terms derived from the alias catalog, `semantic_intake`, selected candidates, and returned route metadata. Write these as `repository_search_terms` in the query plan or workflow notes. Include component names, state names, file names, command names, UI labels, and route names when the lexicon or candidate payload exposes them.

Do not search only the raw user words. If the user's phrase has no direct code match, use `normalized_query`, `alias_interpretations`, candidate titles, candidate aliases, `matched_terms`, `colloquial_matches`, returned paths, and `expanded_queries` to form the first search set. Use these project-language search terms before broad repository search; only widen after the translated terms and returned `minimal_live_reads` fail to identify the owner.

### Concept Selection

`concept_candidates` are not a flat keyword list. Treat them as structured project concept candidates with ownership, route, alias, `matched_terms`, `colloquial_matches`, domain, disambiguation, and confidence signals. Select concepts that match the user's intent and the workflow objective, reject concepts that are unrelated or unsafe to assume, and preserve the `selection_reason` and `concept_decisions` so downstream artifacts can understand why the query was bounded that way. Each `concept_decisions` entry should record `covered_facets`, `missing_facets`, `match_sources`, confidence, and risk. Candidate selection must satisfy facet coverage for the active workflow; do not trust top similarity alone, whether the match came from lexical overlap, vector similarity, aliases, paths, or graph-neighbor expansion.

When candidate concepts conflict, are too broad, or remain unknown, follow the returned compass state instead of guessing. Do not bypass `route_pack`, `minimal_live_reads`, or `first_pass_paths` by expanding into broad repository reads merely because a candidate concept looks interesting.

### Fixed Bundle Consumption

Every workflow must consume the readiness and task-local bundle returned by the project cognition compass packet explicitly required by its command contract. Treat the compass packet as the task-local project navigation bundle. Treat raw graph JSON artifacts as obsolete runtime surfaces. Do not replace bundle consumption with broad freeform repository rereads when the runtime already covers the touched area.

### Query Completion

A project-cognition compass intake is not complete when it returns JSON. It is complete only when readiness drives routing, minimal_live_reads constrains inspection, lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons are considered, and relevant facts are carried into the next workflow artifact or execution state.

Extract and carry forward the selected concepts, rejected concepts, `selection_reason`, `semantic_intake`, `normalized_query`, `intent_facets`, `negative_constraints`, `concept_decisions`, `covered_facets`, `missing_facets`, `match_sources`, `lexicon_generation_id`, matched capability or symptom, affected nodes and subgraph, `route_pack`, `minimal_live_reads`, `first_pass_paths`, `coverage_diagnostics`, missing coverage, evidence traces, verification routes, ambiguity, conflicts, and weak coverage.

### Command Tier Depth

Tier determines how deeply the workflow must continue through the returned bundle
and minimal live reads after the minimum gate, not whether it may skip cognition-runtime consumption.

- `trivial`: minimum required artifact set only
- `light`: minimum artifact set plus relevant routing or playbook artifacts
- `heavy`: minimum artifact set plus all relevant collaboration, propagation, and verification artifacts

### Freshness

Treat runtime freshness as map-quality diagnostics:

- `fresh` -> use the returned task-local bundle as an advisory first pass navigation aid
- `missing` -> if cognition freshness is `missing`, continue with live repository evidence and recommend `$sp-map-scan`, then `$sp-map-build` only as brownfield external baseline maintenance
- `stale` -> if cognition freshness is `stale`, treat map output as advisory and continue with live repository evidence; recommend `$sp-map-update` only as external/manual maintenance when the user asks for map maintenance or before a separate map-maintenance pass
- `stale` with changed paths missing from `path_index` -> warn and continue with live repository evidence; recommend `$sp-map-update` first for ordinary existing-baseline gaps.
  Use `$sp-map-scan -> $sp-map-build` only for brownfield first/missing/unusable baseline, schema failure, schema v1 or old broad-schema rebuild-required readiness, zero active-generation `path_index` rows outside baseline-kind exceptions described below, missing or invalid `alias_index`, `explicit_rebuild_requested`, or `baseline_identity_invalid`
- `support_drift` -> warn and continue with live repository evidence; recommend resolving or intentionally ignoring support-surface drift
- `partial_refresh` -> warn that refresh data was recorded but readiness did not pass; continue with live repository evidence
- `possibly_stale` -> inspect the returned affected scope when useful, then continue with live repository evidence

Preserve the distinction between the machine freshness field and public state
guidance: `freshness` records map quality, while `recommended_next_action` is a
map-maintenance recommendation.

### Greenfield Empty Baseline

If `baseline_kind=greenfield_empty`, continue with workflow artifacts and live requirements. Do not recommend map-scan -> map-build solely because the graph has no paths.

### Mutation Closeout Rule

Entry-time stale or weak cognition is still an advisory navigation concern unless the user explicitly requested map maintenance. A workflow may continue from live evidence when entry guidance allows it. That entry routing rule does not waive closeout ownership.

### Inline Project Cognition Update

Workflow-owned mutation closeout is not an external map-maintenance handoff and is not external map maintenance. It is the workflow-local form of `$sp-map-update`. If this workflow changed project-related source, runtime, templates, generated assets, config, tests, state contracts, shared surfaces, or behavior-bearing docs, closeout MUST run inline project cognition update for the workflow-owned changed paths and affected surfaces before claiming clean completion.

Call the planner first:

```text
C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe closeout-plan --workflow '"$ACTIVE_WORKFLOW"' --format json
```

When `DELTA_SESSION_ID` exists, pass it into the planner:

```text
C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe closeout-plan --workflow '"$ACTIVE_WORKFLOW"' --delta-session '"$DELTA_SESSION_ID"' --format json
```

Consume `workflow_canonical`, `update_mode`, `payload_draft`, `required_agent_fields`, `unknown_paths`, `unknown_path_dispositions`, `delta_append_draft`, display-only `delta_append_command`, `update_argv`, display-only `update_command`, and `recommended_next_command`.

Before running `update`, fill the fields listed in `required_agent_fields` from live evidence from this workflow. Supported agent-owned evidence fields include:

- `verification`
- `behavior_surfaces`
- `generated_surfaces`
- `state_contracts`
- `known_unknowns`
- `confidence_notes`
- `user_decisions`
- `boundary`

If a field appears in `required_agent_fields`, provide live-evidence-backed content for it. Fields not listed by `required_agent_fields`, such as `known_unknowns` and `boundary`, are populated only when live evidence supports them; do not invent them to satisfy the shape.
Use `known_unknowns` only for blockers that make the cognition update unsafe to trust. If the working tree contains unrelated dirty/untracked paths and the workflow uses explicit workflow-owned paths, record that as `confidence_notes` or `boundary.initial_dirty_paths`, not as a blocking `known_unknowns` item.

For each `unknown_path_dispositions[]` item, set `agent_disposition` to exactly one allowed value:

- `adoptable`: verified new path inside this workflow-owned scope; it may be recorded in changed/scope paths and verified adoptable paths do not become blocking `known_unknowns`.
- `review_only`: path informed review but is not adopted into changed coverage.
- `ignored`: path remains excluded and must not enter payloads, records, route indexes, evidence, aliases, or minimal live reads.
- `blocking_known_unknown`: record it as a known unknown and report partial or blocked cognition closeout.

`agent_disposition=adoptable` is an agent accounting decision, not proof that runtime indexing already succeeded. Runtime adoption still requires a usable active project-cognition DB, at least one passing verification evidence item, and no blocking `known_unknowns`. After `update_argv` runs, inspect `result_state`, `adopted_paths`, `review_paths`, `minimal_live_reads`, and `partial_refresh_reasons`; do not explain a remaining `partial_refresh` as "path_index missing" until those fields show which adoption gate failed.

If `update_mode=delta_session`, complete `delta_append_draft.argv_prefix` with agent-owned repeatable flags such as `--behavior-surface`, `--generated-surface`, `--verification`, and accepted `--known-unknown` values from `delta_append_draft.argv_placeholders`. Then append the delta event and run `update_argv`. `delta_append_command` and `update_command` are display-only placeholders, not execution strings.

If `update_mode=payload_file`, write the completed `payload_draft` to the planner's `payload_path`. Then run `update_argv`. `update_command` is a display-only placeholder, not an execution string.

Completed payload drafts preserve the planner-owned `changed_paths` and `scope_paths` and add agent-owned evidence fields before recording.

Structured `update` invalidates related claims and returns their stable IDs in `affected_graph_claims`. This is separate from update readiness: generic workflow verification and `result_state=ready` must not re-promote stale or contradicted graph claims. Only when this workflow already has decisive claim-specific bounded live evidence for an exact returned claim ID may it submit semantic reconciliation intent and run:

```text
C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe claim-reconcile prepare --input '<intent.json>' --format json
C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe claim-reconcile apply --input '<prepared_packet_path>' --format json
```

Provide only reconciliation intent: workflow, stable `claim_id`, reason, and evidence containing repository-relative `source_path`, bounded line `span`, and `supporting` or `contradicting` role. Add verification only when it is claim-specific. The runtime owns the contract version, active generation, expected state and revision, UTC observation and expiry, source kind, content hashes, repository snapshot, IDs, and prepared packet path. Do not author or edit those integrity fields; execute the returned `apply_argv` exactly. If no such evidence exists, leave the claim stale. If reconciliation returns ready, rerun Compass once so later routing consumes the current evidence basis; partial or blocked reconciliation remains withheld and follows `recommended_next_action`.

For compatibility with worker handoffs and delta packets, the runtime also accepts `verification_evidence` as an alias for `verification` and `generated_surface_notes` as an alias for `generated_surfaces`. Verification evidence may be an array of objects (`command`, `result`, `artifact`) or an array of command-result strings, but clean closeout still requires passing verification evidence; failed verification cannot produce a clean `ready` closeout.

Clean closeout keys on `result_state`, not `status=ok`, `update_id`, `last_update_id`, or freshness alone:

- `ready` or `no_op`: project cognition closeout may be clean when ordinary verification also passed.
- `partial_refresh`: useful update data was written, but the final workflow state must report partial cognition closeout, `partial_refresh_reasons`, and the returned `minimal_live_reads`. If `partial_refresh_reasons` includes `missing_passing_verification_result`, repair the payload or delta evidence and rerun `update_argv` before final closeout; do not route that to `sp-map-update`. If verified workflow-owned paths still remain in `review_paths` after the update, report implementation completion separately from project-cognition maintenance and name `$sp-map-update` as follow-up repair.
- `needs_rebuild`: report the exact rebuild condition and route to `$sp-map-scan`, then `$sp-map-build`.
- `blocked`: report the runtime or validation blocker and the exact recovery command.
- `recorded`: legacy recorded-only output; treat it as partial or blocked, never as clean completion.

Never run the `complete-refresh` or `clear-dirty` helper after `result_state=partial_refresh`, `needs_rebuild`, `blocked`, or legacy `recorded`; those helpers are only for states that the runtime and validation prove ready.

Dirty fallback command shape: `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe mark-dirty --reason '"<reason>"' --format json`.
Use `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe mark-dirty --reason '"workflow-closeout-failed"' --format json` only when inline update cannot complete: when the planner or update command is unavailable, cannot record useful update data, cannot identify workflow-owned scope, or cannot be trusted because verification/workflow completion is not trustworthy. Dirty only when inline update cannot complete.

sp-map-update is for manual/external maintenance and follow-up repair. `$sp-map-update` remains the external/manual workflow for user edits, interrupted workflow repair, explicit map maintenance, and follow-up repair. It is not routine cleanup for changes this workflow just made. If `sp-map-update` already ran `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe update --reason map-update` for the same changed paths, do not run a second `workflow-finalize` closeout update for those paths.

### Primary Read Restriction

Do not treat handbook-first or layered project-map files as evidence. If
query-returned coverage is insufficient, inspect live repository surfaces
directly and recommend `sp-map-update` for ordinary existing-baseline gaps,
localized stale cognition refresh, weak localized coverage after a usable
baseline, or external/manual changed-path map maintenance. Use `sp-map-scan -> sp-map-build`
only for brownfield first/missing/unusable baseline, schema failure, schema v1 or old broad-schema rebuild-required readiness, zero active-generation
`path_index` rows outside `greenfield_empty`, missing or invalid `alias_index`, `explicit_rebuild_requested`, or `baseline_identity_invalid`.

The completion claim must be backed by live code, tests, scripts, configuration, or authoritative docs. Project cognition can support route selection but cannot be the sole evidence for completion.

Do not call `project-cognition mark-dirty` unless the active workflow explicitly requires a durable dirty-state record.

<!-- SEMANTIC_WORK_CONTRACT_BEGIN -->
## Semantic Work Contract

[AGENT] Treat every project-cognition-backed request as natural-language intake first, regardless of whether the eventual work looks like planning, research, debugging, implementation, review, or map maintenance.

### Missing cognition launcher

If an installed cognition command begins with the all-caps
`PROJECT_COGNITION_LAUNCHER_UNAVAILABLE` marker, treat the complete marked
command as non-executable; its suffix only preserves the intended subcommand
for managed rebinding. Do not probe `specify cognition` or
`specify project-cognition`. Run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify check`, then
`uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@6fbbf08a0b6833bb783ec6b418d567776b197ae4 specify integration repair`, and re-open the installed command or
reference. If the marker remains, report cognition unavailable and use live
repository evidence only where this workflow permits degraded advisory
navigation.

- **Single unified entrypoint**: the agent is the semantic mediator between the user's words and the project's stored vocabulary. Do not choose debug, implement, plan, or research from the user's raw words. First normalize the request into project terms, surfaces, constraints, exclusions, and evidence needs.
- **WorkContract v1**: before route or write-scope decisions, carry a contract with `raw_request`, `normalized_goal`, `semantic_intake`, `selected_concept_ids`, `rejected_concept_ids`, `evidence_plan`, `permission_decision`, and `learning_contract`.
- **Epistemic contract v1**: read and carry the navigation packet's `epistemic_contract`. Require `graph_role=route_candidate_only`, `fact_source_of_truth=live_repository`, `live_verification_required=true`, `graph_only_claims_allowed=false`, and `unverified_claim_action=withhold`. It cannot authorize source changes and cannot prove current behavior; it cannot grant P3/P4 or make `claim_ready` true. Contradictory live evidence overrides the route candidate.
- **Graph claim namespace**: graph claims are indexed assertions and navigation candidates. They use `graph_claim_type` and graph lifecycle states `candidate`, `supported`, `verified_in_graph_generation`, `contradicted`, and `stale`. Even `verified_in_graph_generation` means only verified inside the active graph generation; it is not current repository truth, does not authorize source changes, and cannot set workflow `claim_ready=true`. Graph claim evidence or verification IDs must not populate `claim_verification_refs`, `claim_authorization_refs`, `workflow_authorization`, or `claim_authorizations[]` without new matching live workflow evidence.
- **Graph reconciliation is not WorkContract authorization**: supply only claim-specific semantic intent to `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe claim-reconcile prepare`, then execute the returned `apply_argv` through `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe claim-reconcile apply`. The runtime owns the revision-bound, expiring integrity packet and derives the graph lifecycle state; callers cannot author integrity preconditions or request a target state. Its result updates route-candidate evidence only and does not populate `claim_verification_refs`, `claim_authorization_refs`, `workflow_authorization`, or `claim_authorizations[]`. After a ready reconciliation, rerun Compass once; final claims still require the separate workflow evidence and authorization below.
- **Workflow final claim namespace**: workflow final claims remain exclusively under `claim_readiness.claim_type`, `active_claim_type`, and the named `root_cause_claim`, `fixed_claim`, `completed_claim`, or `release_safe` authorization rules below. Do not use a bare `claim_type` to map graph claims into workflow final claims. Stale or contradicted graph claims are historical or negative-route context only.
- **Facet coverage**: keep `semantic_intake` decisions explicit about covered facets, missing facets, match sources, and rejected false friends; do not collapse the candidate universe into one top-similarity route.
- **Runtime path**: use compass-first navigation for ordinary generated workflows. Run or emulate `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe compass --intent <intent> --query "$ARGUMENTS" --format json` as the default brownfield intake, then use semantic-intake escalation when the compass packet is draft-like, localized, symptom-first, mixed-language, missing coverage, or needs explicit concept decisions. When that escalation is available, run or emulate `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe semantic-intake --input <work-contract-input.json> --format json`; if the command is unavailable, manually produce the same fields from the alias catalog and existing compass/query guidance.
- **Semantic-intake evidence boundary**: `semantic-intake` can rank candidates, explain match basis, reject false friends, suggest `minimal_live_reads`, and name missing facets. It is not proof that a bug exists, a design is correct, a fix is safe, or a release is ready.
- **v1.1 audit artifact**: when semantic-intake escalation influences routing, capture a replayable WorkContract artifact with the semantic-intake input/output snapshot, selected/rejected basis, permission upgrade/downgrade reason, action log, and route corrections. If available, run or emulate `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe semantic-audit --input <semantic-audit-input.json> --format json` to build that record. The audit artifact records why the route was chosen; it does not authorize source changes, does not read live source, does not raise permission above P2, and does not replace workflow verification.
- **Audit fallback**: if semantic-audit is unavailable, manually produce the same semantic_audit_input fields from the WorkContract, semantic-intake input/output, route decision, permission decision, action log, and route corrections. Do not block on installing a newer runtime solely for semantic-audit; continue only under the lower available permission and prove any later claims with live evidence.
- **v1.2 evidence-guided inspection**: when semantic-audit returns inspection_plan, treat it as the only P2 live-read plan. inspection_plan maps each missing facet or evidence need to a bounded target. Execute targeted_read only for listed target_path or target_id; do not broaden reads from raw user wording. Capture live_evidence_capture before raising permission. Use rerank_after_inspect before any root-cause, fixed, complete, or release-safe claim. Apply stale_index_downgrade when runtime is unavailable, stale, missing owners, or contradicted by live evidence.
- **v1.2.1 captured evidence gate**: workflow-captured live_evidence_capture may feed rerank_assessment, but live evidence can create a permission_promotion_candidate only. candidate_only is not granted permission, not authorization to edit, and not a final claim. route_contradicted downgrades permission, blocks targeted_inspect/change/final claims, and requires rerunning semantic-intake or choosing another route.
- **v1.2.2 owner confidence**: owner_bundle_confidence summarizes indexed owner roles for selected candidates; it is confidence, not live proof. owner_miss_expansion max_radius is 1. If no bounded target_id exists, stop and request map update or user clarification; do not broaden reads.
- **v1.2.3 live source boundary**: route vocabulary evidence is not live source evidence. A live_evidence_capture item may support rerank_assessment only when `source_kind` is `source`, `read_path` names the bounded source read from inspection_plan or selected owner hints, and `supports_candidate` or `contradicts_candidate` is explicit. Otherwise permission_promotion_candidate stays blocked by live_source_evidence_required and bounded_source_evidence_required.
- **v1.3 verification owner discovery**: verification_owner_discovery identifies indexed or missing verification owners and targeted_test candidates. It does not grant P3/P4, does not mark work fixed, and keeps promotion_blocked true until workflow authorization and verification results exist.
- **v1.3.1 verification result ingestion**: verification_results may be recorded after the workflow runs targeted verification. A result satisfies claim_readiness only when every selected candidate has an indexed verification owner, status is passed, and verification_path matches an indexed verification owner for the selected candidate. Without workflow_authorization, claim_status is claim_candidate, claim_ready remains false, and workflow_authorization is still required.
- **v1.3.2 workflow authorization baseline**: workflow_authorization is the explicit bridge from runtime evidence to workflow-owned claims. The v1.3.2 baseline allowed only `root_cause_claim` after bounded source evidence, matching passed verification for every selected candidate, `status: authorized`, `authorized_claims` containing `root_cause_claim`, and a non-empty `authorization_ref`.
- **v1.3.3 claim-specific final claims**: current generated workflows may mark `fixed_claim`, `completed_claim`, or `release_safe` claim_ready only when every selected candidate has claim-specific passed verification, top-level workflow_authorization has `status: authorized`, `authorized_claims` contains that claim, and workflow_authorization contains a matching `claim_authorizations[]` entry with `status: authorized`, a non-empty `authorization_ref`, and `verification_evidence_refs` covering the matched verification results. Empty verification `claim_type` is legacy-compatible only for `root_cause_claim`. Claim readiness still does not grant P3/P4 permission, unblock source edits, or prove release safety beyond the named claim.
- **v1.3.18 verification outcome policy**: failed verification results block final claims until superseded by a newer matching passed rerun and surface `verification_result_failed`; blocked verification results block final claims until recovery or rerun produces a newer matching passed result and surface `verification_result_blocked`; skipped or otherwise inconclusive verification results block final claims and surface `verification_result_inconclusive`. A newer passed rerun may recover claim candidacy only when it matches the same indexed verification owner path and selected candidate. These blockers explain verification state; they do not prove root cause, authorize source edits, or grant P3/P4 permission.
- **v1.3.19 active claim authorization policy**: workflow_authorization.active_claim_type records the single active final claim when a workflow authorizes more than one claim type. Multiple authorized claims require explicit active_claim_type; otherwise claim readiness stays blocked with `active_claim_type_required`. If active_claim_type is not listed in authorized_claims, claim readiness stays blocked with `active_claim_not_authorized`. Single-claim authorization remains backward-compatible and still does not infer claims from workflow names.
- **v1.3.4 audit state persistence**: persist semantic-audit-input.json and semantic-audit-output.json next to the active workflow state. Use `semantic_audit_input_path` and `semantic_audit_output_path` to record the exact files, with `<WORKFLOW_STATE_DIR>/semantic-audit-input.json` and `<WORKFLOW_STATE_DIR>/semantic-audit-output.json` as the default when a workflow-state directory exists. On resume, re-read `semantic_audit_state`, both persisted audit files, `claim_authorization_refs`, and `claim_verification_refs` before recomputing claim_readiness or making final claims. If any referenced file is missing, stale, or inconsistent with the current route decision, set `semantic_audit_resume_status` to `missing|stale|needs-rerun` and rerun or rebuild the audit instead of trusting chat memory.
- **v1.3.5 resume validation**: before trusting persisted claim_readiness on resume, compare selected_candidate_ids, active_claim_type, claim_authorization_refs, and claim_verification_refs from workflow state against the persisted semantic-audit-output.json. Record the comparison in `semantic_audit_resume_validation` and `semantic_audit_route_fingerprint`. If selected candidates, active claim type, authorization refs, verification refs, or route decision fingerprint differ, set `semantic_audit_resume_status: needs-rerun` and rebuild semantic-audit-input.json before any final claim.
- **v1.3.6 generated resume smoke**: generated workflows must perform a prompt-level generated resume smoke before trusting persisted semantic-audit state. Verify that semantic-audit-input.json and semantic-audit-output.json exist. Compare selected_candidate_ids, active_claim_type, and semantic_audit_route_fingerprint against workflow state plus `semantic-audit-input.json.semantic_audit_input.route_decision`; compare claim_authorization_refs and claim_verification_refs against `semantic-audit-output.json.workflow_authorization and semantic-audit-output.json.claim_readiness`. Record `semantic_audit_generated_resume_smoke` and `semantic_audit_stale_reasons`. Stale-state detection remains prompt-only in v1.3.6. Fingerprint mismatches are route-changed. Use the semantic audit resume examples at `.specify/templates/examples/semantic-audit-resume/scenarios.md` when available. If any smoke check fails, set `semantic_audit_resume_status: needs-rerun`, keep claim_ready false, and rebuild semantic-audit-input.json before any final claim.
- **v1.3.9 optional runtime validator**: when available, generated workflows may run `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe semantic-audit-resume --input <resume-validation.json> --format json` as an optional runtime validator for the same resume smoke. The input should contain extracted workflow state plus concrete paths to persisted semantic-audit-input.json and semantic-audit-output.json; do not require the runtime to parse workflow-state.md. Prompt fallback remains valid when the command is unavailable, blocked, or unnecessary. The validator is a comparison helper only and does not authorize source edits, final claims, or P3/P4 permission. Its output records `validator: semantic-audit-resume`, `can_reuse_persisted_claim_readiness`, `grants_permission: false`, and `boundary: comparison_only_no_source_edit_or_claim_authorization`.
- **v1.3.10 downstream validator examples**: generated projects include concrete runtime-adoption fixtures under `.specify/templates/examples/semantic-audit-resume/`. Use `resume-validation.json` as the fresh example and `resume-validation-route-changed.json` as the stale route example; both reference sibling `semantic-audit-input.json` and `semantic-audit-output.json`. These examples demonstrate the optional validator input shape and expected output without making the validator mandatory.
- **v1.3.11 resume validator workflow preference**: on resume, prefer the optional runtime validator when a compatible `C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe semantic-audit-resume` command is available. Build an ephemeral resume-validation.json from the current workflow state's semantic_audit_state plus concrete `semantic_audit_input_path` and `semantic_audit_output_path`, run the validator, and copy its smoke status, validation status, stale reasons, and reuse decision back into workflow state. If the validator returns fresh and `can_reuse_persisted_claim_readiness: true`, the workflow may reuse persisted claim readiness for the same active claim; this still does not grant P3/P4 permission or source edits. If the validator is unavailable, blocked, or returns stale output, prompt fallback remains valid and any failed result keeps final claims blocked until semantic-audit-input.json is rebuilt.
- **v1.3.12 stale case matrix**: generated projects also include executable stale fixtures for `resume-validation-active-claim-changed.json`, `resume-validation-missing-file.json`, `resume-validation-claim-ref-mismatch.json`, and `resume-validation-verification-ref-mismatch.json`. Use them to understand how the optional validator reports each stale reason before trusting resumed claim readiness.
- **v1.3.13 real downstream resume smoke**: generated-project tests verify the validator with workflow-local semantic-audit-input.json and workflow-local semantic-audit-output.json under an actual downstream state directory, plus an ephemeral resume-validation.json built from that local state. Treat this as the adoption proof: examples teach the shape, while workflow-local files prove path resolution and resume behavior.
- **Workflow-written audit input**: when a workflow uses semantic-intake escalation, write or carry `semantic-audit-input.json` in workflow state before broad live reads. The object is named `"semantic_audit_input"` in notes/handoffs and has this minimum shape:

- **PermissionDecision**: carry `maximum_without_live_evidence` explicitly.
  - `P0`: no usable cognition baseline; ask for or gather minimal live evidence before route claims.
  - `P1`: route/read-only candidate selection only; no source edits.
  - `P2`: bounded live reads and artifact planning are allowed; source edits still require workflow authorization plus live evidence.
  - Higher permissions require live repository evidence, active workflow rules, and verification signals outside semantic intake.
- **Permission-gated actions**: do not use semantic intake alone to authorize source changes, destructive operations, dependency changes, broad refactors, root-cause claims, fixed claims, complete claims, or release-safe claims.
- **LearningContract**: carry the memory level separately from action permission.
  - `M0`: no durable learning; runtime unavailable, match ambiguous, or evidence missing.
  - `M1`: candidate lesson only; record in working state if useful, but do not promote as durable project truth.
  - `M2`: durable learning only after live evidence or verified artifacts prove the lesson is reusable.
- **Final claim gate**: do not claim root cause, fixed, complete, or release-safe from `semantic-intake`, alias ranking, or similarity alone. Root-cause claims require bounded live source evidence, matching passed verification for every selected candidate, and explicit workflow_authorization. Fixed, complete, and release-safe claims additionally require claim-specific passed verification and a matching claim_authorizations entry. Multiple authorized claims require explicit active_claim_type. Failed, blocked, skipped, or inconclusive verification blocks final claims until a newer matching passed rerun supersedes it. These gates do not grant source-edit permission or release approval beyond the named claim.
