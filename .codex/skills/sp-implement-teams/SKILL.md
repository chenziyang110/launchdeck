## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `$sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



## Workflow Contract Summary

- **When to use**: The work is already ready for `sp-implement`, but you explicitly want the durable teams runtime as the execution backend.
- **Primary objective**: Execute the same implementation contract through the Codex-only teams surface rather than through a lighter runtime path.
- **Primary outputs**: The normal implementation lifecycle artifacts plus team-runtime state, worktrees, and leader-visible progress signals.
- **Default handoff**: Continue coordinated implementation through the teams runtime; use cleanup or recovery only through the internal surfaces named below.
- **Execution note**: This summary is routing metadata only. Follow the full contract below end-to-end rather than inferring behavior from the description alone.

## Blocked Exit Contract

If blocked after safe recovery, read and follow
`.specify/templates/workflow-blocker-template.md` and its JSON schema. Never
return only an error or “ask a human”; preserve state and keep agent-capable
repair agent-owned. Set `human_action_required: true` only for authority,
credentials, protected systems, human decisions/reviews, or physical access.
Tailor steps, expected results, failure paths, evidence, and resume action to
CI, visual review, or product decisions. Never claim completion.

# Codex Implement Teams

## Objective

Run the existing implementation contract through the durable Codex teams runtime when the current batch needs explicit coordinated team execution.

## Context

- This surface is Codex-only and implementation-phase-only.
- It assumes `tasks.md` is already ready and the work should follow the same shared contract as `sp-implement`.
- The teams runtime is the backend, not a replacement workflow contract.

## Process

- Validate runtime prerequisites, leader workspace state, and extension availability.
- Route the prepared implementation batch through the teams runtime backend.
- Keep the same tracker, packet, join-point, and result-handoff semantics as the canonical implementation workflow.

## Output Contract

- Produce the same implementation lifecycle outcomes as `sp-implement`, plus the expected teams runtime state and visibility artifacts.
- Keep the user-facing narrative framed as coordinated teams execution rather than extension internals.

## Guardrails

- Do not teach internal extension commands as the primary product surface.
- Do not use this command before `tasks.md` is ready.
- Do not weaken the shared `sp-implement` contract just because the runtime backend changed.

## Project Learning

The CLI is the only agent-facing Learning read surface:

1. Run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@4a631657f75460886dbd12ebe48b14fc11cfe0bf specify learning start --command <classic-command-name> --format json` before deeper non-trivial work.
2. Select summaries by applicability and triggers; use `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@4a631657f75460886dbd12ebe48b14fc11cfe0bf specify learning list --command <classic-command-name> --format json` only to filter or page.
3. Execute one matching card's `show_argv`. Do not parse Learning storage.

`start`, `list`, and `show` are read-only. Current repository evidence,
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and explicit user direction override stale or
candidate Learning.

At closeout, corrections, retries, route changes, recovery, false leads, hidden
dependencies, validation/tooling/state/cognition gaps, constraints, and near
misses are capture signals. Prefer `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@4a631657f75460886dbd12ebe48b14fc11cfe0bf specify learning capture-auto`
from owning state; manual capture includes summary, problem, action, triggers,
success criteria, avoid items, exceptions, and evidence.

- `fast`: skip unless the task escalates.
- `accept`, `analyze`, `ask`, `auto`, `constitution`, `explain`,
  `implement-teams`, `taskstoissues`, and `team`: consume-only; do not violate
  their write boundaries to capture.
- Other non-trivial workflows: consume before deeper work; capture reusable
  signals at closeout or record a no-learning decision.

The `policy` returned by the CLI is authoritative when prompt wording drifts.

## Boundary

1. Codex-only
2. Implementation-phase entry point only; use it after the active execution batch is known
3. On Windows, support only `native Windows + psmux`
4. Requires a clean leader workspace for runtime worktrees
5. This is the user-facing surface; use `sp-teams` as the runtime surface and do not teach extension internals as the primary product surface

## When To Use

Use this when:

1. `sp-implement` identifies coordination that must outlive one in-session delegated wave
2. you want the current feature implemented through durable coordinated team lanes
3. the work has already been decomposed into task-ready execution slices


## Shared Contract With `sp-implement`

`sp-implement` remains the canonical implementation workflow. `sp-implement-teams` is the same execution contract with the concrete team-managed work pinned to the teams runtime.

When you use `sp-implement-teams`, keep the same leader-owned execution semantics that `sp-implement` requires:

1. keep canonical task status, compact execution state, and one lifecycle record per executed task aligned
2. compile and validate a `WorkerTaskPacket` just in time before assigning each team-managed execution task
3. for implementation-oriented teams flows, preserve the user-visible fields `execution_model`, `dispatch_shape`, and `execution_surface`
4. preserve explicit join behavior, blocker/recovery reporting, event-triggered review, and completion checks
5. preserve the team result contract and canonical result file handoff path
6. preserve final-completion truthfulness: do not describe `core implementation complete`, `implementation complete`, or `ready for integration testing` as overall feature completion while required E2E, Polish, documentation, quickstart, or validation work remains

Every team-managed task in the teams-backed flow must still behave like an explicit execution packet, not a chat-only summary. Preserve these fields whenever the backend exposes task records, mailbox messages, or equivalent runtime-managed assignments:

1. task id and subject
2. write set and shared surfaces
3. required references and forbidden drift
4. explicit verification command or acceptance check
5. canonical result handoff path or runtime-managed result channel expectation
6. completion-handoff protocol covering start, blocker, and final completion evidence
7. platform guardrails such as supported platforms, conditional compilation requirements, or other environment-sensitive constraints

Before the teams runtime starts concrete work, ensure the current ready batch is prepared the same way `sp-implement` would prepare it:

1. the current batch is recorded in canonical task and compact execution state
2. each team-managed task has a validated `WorkerTaskPacket`
3. join point expectations and result handoff expectations are explicit
4. the team-managed lane cannot be treated as complete from a status flip alone; the leader still needs the promised completion handoff or result evidence

Before assigning team-managed work, preserve the same project cognition compass contract that `sp-implement` uses:

1. run `project-cognition compass --intent implement --query="$ARGUMENTS" --format json` and include the compass packet in the execution context bundle
2. Read and carry `epistemic_contract`; require `graph_role=route_candidate_only`, `fact_source_of_truth=live_repository`, `live_verification_required=true`, `graph_only_claims_allowed=false`, and `unverified_claim_action=withhold`. The contract cannot authorize source changes and cannot prove current behavior; contradictory live evidence overrides the route candidate. Graph claims are indexed assertions; even `verified_in_graph_generation` is only an active graph-generation state, not current repository truth. Graph claims cannot authorize source changes and cannot set workflow `claim_ready=true`; bounded live evidence and the separate workflow final-claim gate remain required. Carry `epistemic_contract` in every teammate context packet.
3. read top-level `minimal_live_reads` first, then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons, evidence hints, `verification_hints`, `followup_surfaces`, and `before_fix_claim` checks
4. preserve `coverage_diagnostics` as confidence and closeout signals, not route candidates
5. treat `expansion_ref` as a normal continuation path and run `project-cognition expand --id <id> --section <section> --format json` only when coverage state or live evidence requires more map detail
6. do not infer final edit scope from `minimal_live_reads` or `first_pass_paths`; carry them as advisory first-pass evidence routes in every teammate context packet
7. use the advanced `lexicon -> semantic_intake -> query` path only when explicit concept decisions are needed or coverage cannot be resolved from the default compass packet
8. in that precision escalation, normalize user input and write a `semantic_intake` object with `workflow_intent`, `normalized_query`, `intent_facets`, `negative_constraints`, `alias_interpretations`, and `open_semantic_questions`
9. treat `agent_normalization.required=true` as a non-intelligent CLI reminder to write `semantic_intake` from the alias catalog (raw lexicon ranking is only a bootstrap; action: write_semantic_intake_from_alias_catalog); if `agent_normalization` is omitted, treat it as `required=false`, not as proof that raw lexical ranking is authoritative
10. keep CJK or mixed CJK/ASCII input in agent-owned normalization even when positive raw lexical matches exist because embedded project tokens do not translate the surrounding user language; the agent still owns translation and `agent_normalization` is advisory guidance, not a route decision
11. keep `alias_interpretations` object-shaped, for example `{"alias": "<user term>", "meaning": "<project term>", "confidence": "medium"}`, never as a string array
12. build a `query_plan` with `selected_concepts`, `rejected_concepts`, `concept_decisions`, `covered_facets`, `missing_facets`, `match_sources`, `lexicon_generation_id`, `expanded_queries`, `repository_search_terms`, and justified `paths`
13. derive project-language search terms from the alias catalog before source search; do not search only the raw user words; include component names, state names, file names, command names, UI labels, and route names from candidates, aliases, matched terms, returned paths, `normalized_query`, and `expanded_queries`
14. run `project-cognition query --intent implement --query-plan "<query_plan_json>" --format json` only for that precision escalation, and preserve returned readiness, `minimal_live_reads`, `first_pass_paths`, and the task-local bundle in every teammate context packet
15. if the query reports diagnostics, preserve `warnings`, `repair_hints`, normalized `query_plan`, structured `errors`, and `expected_shape` so the leader can repair the plan instead of losing the diagnostics in team chat

The only intended difference is the dispatch path:

1. `sp-implement` may route the current ready batch through subagents first
2. `sp-implement-teams` forces the concrete team-managed execution through the teams runtime for the same batch and join-point semantics
3. the teams runtime must not weaken the tracker, packet, validation, or completion contract

## Execution Contract

1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse `FEATURE_DIR` and `AVAILABLE_DOCS` list. All paths must be absolute.
2. If the prerequisites output does not resolve a `FEATURE_DIR` with canonical `task-index.json` or a light direct task list, stop and run `sp-tasks` first instead of guessing from chat state.
3. Confirm the current project is using the Codex integration.
4. Read compact execution state, canonical task authority, and the current task lifecycle record; recover the active batch from those revisions before trusting rendered task markers.
5. Treat canonical task status plus lifecycle records as implementation truth. `implement-tracker.md` is compatibility state only where existing hooks require it.
6. Confirm the native runtime backend is ready through the official `sp-teams` runtime checks.
7. Run `sp-teams doctor` before the first teams dispatch for the current feature so executor availability, latest transcript, failed dispatches, and team-state evidence are visible up front.
8. When the runtime was newly installed, recently repaired, or still looks suspect after `doctor`, run `sp-teams live-probe` before touching the real implementation batch.
9. On Windows, require the same native shell to resolve `psmux`, `codex`, `node`, `npm`, `cargo`, and `git`.
10. Route durable execution through `sp-teams` and its runtime/API surfaces.
11. Preserve the shared `sp-implement` contract: revision continuity, just-in-time validated `WorkerTaskPacket`s, explicit join points, event-triggered review, and structured result handoff discipline.
12. If the current feature already has an active runtime session, resume or reuse it. Do not create a second runtime team for the same feature.
13. If a create/start call fails because the feature already has an active runtime leader, treat that as a resume signal: inspect the existing session, reconcile tracker/task state, and continue from the recorded ready batch.
14. Use `sp-teams result-template --request-id <id>` or `sp-teams submit-result --print-schema` for structured result handoff instead of ad hoc JSON guessing. Treat the generated template as a `pending` placeholder only; do not submit it unchanged.
15. Materialize each subagent lane as an explicit execution packet: write set, required references, forbidden drift, validation command, completion-handoff protocol, and platform guardrails must stay visible to the leader and subagent.
16. Treat a blocked baseline build as a pre-dispatch runtime concern; do not mix existing repo compile debt into the current batch verdict.
17. After managed team execution, use `sp-teams sync-back` when leader-visible results need to be promoted from runtime worktrees back into the active workspace.
18. Distinguish lane-local completion from repo-global verification: `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` means the lane finished with follow-up concerns, while repo-wide failure may still be caused by baseline debt.
19. Every join point that gates downstream work must have an explicit validation target, validation command or check, and pass condition before the runtime crosses it.
20. After each completed join point or ready batch, re-read the tracker and task state, select the next ready batch and continue automatically. Stop only when no ready work remains, a real blocker stops progress, or an explicit human gate is reached.
21. Planned validation tasks are still ready work. If the remaining tasks are executable tests, E2E checks, security verification, quickstart validation, or other scripted validation work already present in `tasks.md`, continue automatically instead of asking whether validation should start.
22. Do not stop to ask whether validation should start unless a manual-only check or approval step is explicitly recorded in the tracker or task plan.
23. Do not stop after a single completed batch just because the current assignee, subagent, or runtime lane has gone idle; idle without remaining-work analysis is not a terminal condition.
24. If a lane flips to `completed` or drifts into `idle` before the promised result handoff or completion evidence arrives, treat it as a stale lane and recover explicitly instead of counting it as finished work.
25. Use the teams runtime as the execution backend for the prepared batch rather than as a replacement for the `sp-implement` contract.
26. If the user only wants to inspect the Codex runtime surface before implementing, redirect them to `sp-teams` or `$sp-teams`.

## Output Expectations

Successful runs should leave the user with:

1. canonical team state under `.specify/teams/state`
2. worker worktrees under `.specify/teams/worktrees` or the active runtime worktree root
3. leader-visible progress through the team mailbox and monitor snapshot
4. the same implementation lifecycle semantics as `sp-implement`, including tracker continuity, join point visibility, and result handoff discipline
5. executor diagnostics and latest transcript evidence available through `sp-teams doctor`
6. a repeatable minimal runtime acceptance check available through `sp-teams live-probe`
7. implementation framed as "teams execution" through the official `sp-teams` runtime rather than extension internals
8. a formal structured result template via `sp-teams result-template`
9. an official sync-back path when worker worktrees and the main workspace diverge
10. batch outcome visibility that distinguishes lane-local completion from repo-global verification blockers

## Codex Subagent Result Contract

- Worker result contract: preserve the shared `WorkerTaskResult` semantics even when the runtime calls lanes subagents.
- Preferred result contract: WorkerTaskResult contract with status, changed files, validation evidence, blockers, failed assumptions, and recovery guidance.
- Result file handoff path: .specify/teams/state/results/<request-id>.json
- Runtime-managed result paths require a dispatch request id; compute the path with `specify result path --command implement --request-id <request-id>` and report final completion through the active runtime-managed result channel for that request id.
- `specify result path` emits JSON and does not accept `--format`; do not append `--format`.
- Normalize subagent-reported statuses like `DONE`, `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `BLOCKED`, and `NEEDS_CONTEXT` into the shared `WorkerTaskResult` contract before the leader accepts the handoff.
- Keep `reported_status` when normalization occurs so runtime-specific subagent language can be reconciled with canonical orchestration state.
- Wait for every subagent's structured handoff before accepting the join point, closing the batch, or declaring completion.
- Do not treat an idle subagent as done work; idle without a consumed handoff means the result channel is still unresolved.
- Do not interrupt or shut down subagent work before the handoff has been written or explicitly reported as `BLOCKED` or `NEEDS_CONTEXT`.
- Treat `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` as completed work plus follow-up concerns, not as silent success.
- Treat `NEEDS_CONTEXT` as a blocked handoff that must carry the missing context or failed assumption explicitly.
