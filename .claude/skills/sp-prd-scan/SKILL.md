## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `/sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



## Blocked Exit Contract

If blocked after safe recovery, read and follow
`.specify/templates/workflow-blocker-template.md` and its JSON schema. Never
return only an error or “ask a human”; preserve state and keep agent-capable
repair agent-owned. Set `human_action_required: true` only for authority,
credentials, protected systems, human decisions/reviews, or physical access.
Tailor steps, expected results, failure paths, evidence, and resume action to
CI, visual review, or product decisions. Never claim completion.

# `/sp.prd-scan` Reconstruction Scan

## Workflow Contract Summary

This summary is routing metadata only. The full workflow contract is the frontmatter plus the sections below.

- Use `sp-prd-scan` for read-only reconstruction investigation.
- Primary truth source: current repository reality plus the `project-cognition query` bundle and compatibility/export evidence when explicitly needed.
- Primary terminal state: completed scan package under `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/`.
- Stable freshness state: `.specify/prd/status.json`.
- Default handoff: `/sp-prd-build`.

## Project Learning

The CLI is the only agent-facing Learning read surface:

1. Run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@4a631657f75460886dbd12ebe48b14fc11cfe0bf specify learning start --command <classic-command-name> --format json` before deeper non-trivial work.
2. Select summaries by applicability and triggers; use `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@4a631657f75460886dbd12ebe48b14fc11cfe0bf specify learning list --command <classic-command-name> --format json` only to filter or page.
3. Execute one matching card's `show_argv`. Do not parse Learning storage.

`start`, `list`, and `show` are read-only. Current repository evidence,
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and explicit user direction override stale or
candidate Learning.

At closeout, corrections, retries, route changes, recovery, false leads, hidden
dependencies, validation/tooling/state/cognition gaps, constraints, and near
misses are capture signals. Prefer `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@4a631657f75460886dbd12ebe48b14fc11cfe0bf specify learning capture-auto`
from owning state; manual capture includes summary, problem, action, triggers,
success criteria, avoid items, exceptions, and evidence.

- `fast`: skip unless the task escalates.
- `accept`, `analyze`, `ask`, `auto`, `constitution`, `explain`,
  `implement-teams`, `taskstoissues`, and `team`: consume-only; do not violate
  their write boundaries to capture.
- Other non-trivial workflows: consume before deeper work; capture reusable
  signals at closeout or record a no-learning decision.

The `policy` returned by the CLI is authoritative when prompt wording drifts.

[AGENT] For project-cognition-backed semantic intake, routing, audit, resume, or final-claim gates, read `references/semantic-work-contract.md`.

## Detailed References

Read [Reference index](references/INDEX.md) before applying shared semantic contracts.

- [semantic work contract](references/semantic-work-contract.md)

## Objective

[AGENT] Produce a reconstruction-grade scan package that lets `sp-prd-build` compile a PRD suite without rereading the repository.

The scan phase is a read-only reconstruction investigation. It must harvest enough grounded detail about each `capability`, `artifact`, and `boundary` to prove whether the package is reconstruction-ready or should be marked `blocked-by-gap`.
Every consequential claim must preserve `Evidence`, `Inference`, and `Unknown` labeling semantics instead of collapsing them into one unmarked narrative.

## Context

Required context inputs:

- **Project cognition gate:** query the active project's runtime before broad
  repository reads.

  Run or emulate:

  ```text
  C:\Users\11034\.specify\bin\project-cognition.exe compass --intent research --query=\"$ARGUMENTS\" --format json
  ```

  After the default compass packet, run the advanced `lexicon -> semantic_intake -> query` path only when `compass_state`, coverage diagnostics, localization, or live evidence requires explicit concept decisions. In that escalation, use `project-cognition lexicon --mode catalog` as the alias catalog, write agent-authored `semantic_intake` and `concept_decisions`, then run `project-cognition query --query-plan "<query_plan_json>"`; include `query_plan`, `semantic_intake`, `concept_decisions`, `covered_facets`, `missing_facets`, `match_sources`, `lexicon_generation_id`, `repository_search_terms`, project-language search terms, and facet coverage; do not search only the raw user words before source search. Agent-owned semantic normalization remains mandatory: `agent_normalization` and raw lexicon ranking are bootstrap signals only; if `agent_normalization` is omitted, treat it as `required=false`; use `write_semantic_intake_from_alias_catalog` when needed. Raw lexicon ranking is only a bootstrap; CJK or mixed CJK/ASCII input still requires agent-owned normalization even when positive raw lexical matches exist. The agent still owns translation. Readiness values are `query_ready`, `review`, `needs_rebuild`, `blocked`, and `unsupported_runtime`.

  Use the returned readiness:

  - `query_ready`: read top-level `minimal_live_reads` first, then use lane-level `first_pass_paths` reasons.
  - `review`: perform only the returned `minimal_live_reads` before continuing and inspect `coverage_diagnostics`.
  - `blocked`: report the blocking runtime issue and continue with live evidence only where this workflow allows degraded navigation.
- `PROJECT-HANDBOOK.md` only when compatibility/export evidence is explicitly relevant.
- `.specify/prd/status.json` as the stable PRD scan freshness record when present.
- Current repository evidence from code, docs, tests, routes, UI surfaces, service surfaces, data models, integrations, configuration, and deployment surfaces.
- Existing `workflow-state.md` under `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/` when resuming an interrupted run.

## Mandatory Subagent Execution

All substantive tasks in ordinary `sp-*` workflows default to and must use subagents.

The leader orchestrates: route, split tasks, prepare task contracts, dispatch subagents, wait for structured handoffs, integrate results, verify, and update state.

Before dispatch, every subagent lane needs a task contract with objective, authoritative inputs, allowed read scope, forbidden actions, acceptance checks, verification evidence, and structured handoff format.

Use `execution_model: subagent-mandatory`.
Use `dispatch_shape: one-subagent | parallel-subagents`.
Use `execution_surface: native-subagents`.
Each delegated lane produces a `PrdScanPacket`: a read-only evidence packet with enough cited detail for the build step to synthesize the final archive without rereading the repository.

## Unified Critical Item Families

1. Main Capability Chains
2. External Entrypoints and Command Surfaces
3. State Machines and Flow Control
4. Data and Persistence Contracts
5. Configuration and Behavior Switches
6. Protocol and Boundary Contracts
7. Error Semantics and Recovery Behavior
8. Verification and Regression Entrypoints

## Evidence Depth Model

- `L1 Exists`: the item is discovered and tied to at least one repository surface.
- `L2 Surface`: the user-visible, command, API, config, data, or boundary shape is captured.
- `L3 Behavioral`: normal behavior, edge behavior, state changes, and failure behavior are grounded in evidence.
- `L4 Reconstruction-Ready`: enough structure, contracts, and verification evidence exist to recreate the behavior without critical unknowns.

## Hard Boundary

- `sp-prd-scan` must not write `master/master-pack.md`.
- `sp-prd-scan` must not write `exports/**`.
- `sp-prd-scan` must not claim the PRD suite is complete.

## PRD Run State Protocol

- `workflow-state.md` under `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/` is the resumable state surface for `sp-prd-scan` and `sp-prd-build`.
- [AGENT] Create or resume `workflow-state.md` before substantial scan work.
- If `workflow-state.md` exists with `active_command: sp-prd-scan` and a non-terminal scan state, resume from it instead of rebuilding intent from chat memory.
- Track at least:
  - `active_command: sp-prd-scan`
  - `status: scanning | synthesizing | blocked | ready-for-build`
  - `scan_status: pending | scanning | blocked | complete`
  - `build_status`
  - `freshness_mode`
  - `classification`
  - `selected_capabilities`
  - `selected_boundaries`
  - `selected_artifacts`
  - `current_packet`
  - `accepted_packet_results`
  - `rejected_packet_results`
  - `failed_readiness_checks`
  - `next_action`
  - `next_command`
  - `handoff_reason`
  - `open_gaps`

## Process

1. Route and initialize the PRD run under `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/`.
2. Load brownfield context and select the smallest relevant repository surfaces.
3. Check `.specify/prd/status.json` freshness before scoping the scan.
4. Route `fresh` status to status confirmation only unless the user explicitly requests a new run.
5. Route `targeted-stale` status to a bounded scan of the changed source, test, and documentation surfaces plus any directly adjacent capability boundaries.
6. Route `full-stale` status to a full reconstruction scan across command, workflow, integration, configuration, and shared-runtime surfaces.
7. Triage `capability`, `artifact`, and `boundary` objects before broad synthesis.
8. Assign each capability a tier: `critical`, `high`, `standard`, or `auxiliary`.
9. Before broad scan fan-out begins, assess workload shape and the current agent capability snapshot, then apply the shared policy contract: `choose_subagent_dispatch(command_name="prd-scan", snapshot, workload_shape)`.
10. Persist the decision fields exactly: `execution_model: subagent-mandatory`, `dispatch_shape: one-subagent | parallel-subagents`, `execution_surface: native-subagents`.
11. Decision order is fixed:
    - One safe validated scan lane -> `one-subagent` on `native-subagents` when available.
    - Two or more safe read-only scan lanes -> `parallel-subagents` on `native-subagents` when available.
    - No safe lane, incomplete packet, or unavailable delegation -> `subagent-blocked` with a recorded reason.
12. Compile a validated `PrdScanPacket` before dispatch or `subagent-blocked` status.
13. For `one-subagent`, dispatch one read-only scan lane once a validated `PrdScanPacket` exists. If the packet is incomplete, compile the missing fields before dispatch; if dispatch is unavailable, record `subagent-blocked` with the blocker and stop for escalation or recovery before broad scan work continues.
14. If collaboration is justified, keep `prd-scan` lanes read-only and limited to reconstruction evidence gathering, tier classification, and packet drafting.
15. Required join points:
    - before freezing ledgers and machine-readable contracts
    - before declaring the package ready for `sp-prd-build`
16. The leader owns final ledger normalization, contract updates, and packet quality even when subagents help with scan work.
17. For `critical` and `high` capabilities, capture stronger reconstruction detail: structure, producers, consumers, constraints, compatibility behavior, and failure behavior.
18. Build `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/artifact-contracts.json` and `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/reconstruction-checklist.json`.
19. Generate scan packets and evidence notes that explain structure, producers, consumers, constraints, and failure behavior while preserving `Evidence`, `Inference`, and `Unknown`.
20. Refuse handoff if any `critical` capability lacks reconstruction-ready support. `high` capabilities must not be waved through with path-only evidence; keep the status explicit as `blocked-by-gap` when evidence is insufficient.

## Output Contract

The scan phase writes only the reconstruction package:

- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/workflow-state.md`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/prd-scan.md`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/coverage-ledger.md`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/coverage-ledger.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/capability-ledger.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/artifact-contracts.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/reconstruction-checklist.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/entrypoint-ledger.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/config-contracts.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/protocol-contracts.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/state-machines.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/error-semantics.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/verification-surfaces.json`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/scan-packets/<lane-id>.md`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/evidence/**`
- `.specify/prd-runs/<run-id>/worker-results/**`
- `.specify/prd/status.json` when initializing a successful scan and the stable status file is absent

These artifacts are the authoritative scan bundle for `sp-prd-build`; they are not draft exports.

## Compile And Validate PrdScanPacket Inputs

- [AGENT] Compile a validated `PrdScanPacket` before dispatch or `subagent-blocked` status.
- A valid `PrdScanPacket` must include:
  - `lane_id`
  - `mode: read_only`
  - `scope`
  - `capability_ids`
  - `artifact_ids`
  - `boundary_ids`
  - `required_reads`
  - `excluded_paths`
  - `required_questions`
  - `expected_outputs`
  - `contract_targets`
  - `forbidden_actions`
  - `result_handoff_path`
  - `join_points`
  - `minimum_verification`
  - `blocked_conditions`
- Hard rule: do not dispatch from raw scan prose or broad chat instructions alone.

## PrdScanPacket Dispatch

- If no safe lane exists, the packet is incomplete, or delegation is unavailable, record `subagent-blocked` with the blocker and stop for escalation or recovery before broad scan work continues.
- Raw inventory notes or raw chat summaries are not sufficient subagent inputs or outputs.
- Each dispatched lane needs a validated `PrdScanPacket` and must return a structured handoff with inspected paths, key facts, confidence, blockers, and recommended contract updates.
- Idle subagent output is not an accepted scan result.
- The leader must wait for every dispatched lane and consume its structured handoff before finalizing ledgers, writing scan packets, or marking the scan complete.

## Worker Result Contract

Every scan-lane result must include:

- `lane_id`
- `reported_status: done | done_with_concerns | blocked | needs_context`
- `paths_read`
- `key_facts`
- `evidence_refs`
- `recommended_contract_updates`
- `confidence`
- `unknowns`
- `minimum_verification`
- `result_handoff_path`

Reject results that omit `paths_read`, collapse evidence into prose-only summary, hide `unknowns`, or leave contract impact undefined where one is expected.

## Quality Gates

- Stable Status Gate: `.specify/prd/status.json` must be consulted or initialized, and the run must record whether freshness is `fresh`, `targeted-stale`, or `full-stale`.
- Capability Triage Gate: each capability must be assigned `critical`, `high`, `standard`, or `auxiliary` before scan completion can be claimed.
- Critical Depth Gate: each `critical` capability must be explicitly marked `reconstruction-ready` or `blocked-by-gap`, with structure, producer-consumer, constraint, and failure coverage captured.
- High Capability Gate: each `high` capability must have more than path-only evidence and must record reconstruction-relevant structure and boundary behavior.
- Artifact Contract Gate: important structures must land in `artifact-contracts.json`.
- Checklist Gate: recreation blockers and remaining `Unknown` items must be visible in `reconstruction-checklist.json`.
- Evidence Label Gate: scan outputs must preserve `Evidence`, `Inference`, and `Unknown` labeling semantics.

## Guardrails

- Do not write final PRD exports in `sp-prd-scan`.
- Do not treat path discovery as sufficient reconstruction evidence.
- Do not let `critical` or `high` capabilities pass with shallow evidence only.
- Do not hide unknowns that block a later build step.
- When refusal is required, report the smallest safe repair instead of softening the gap into narrative prose.

## Claude Code Subagent Capability Discovery

- Execution model: preserve the workflow's existing `subagent-mandatory`, `subagents-first`, `adaptive`, or `subagent-assisted` policy.
- Dispatch shape: preserve the workflow's existing dispatch shape; use `subagent-blocked` only after the discovery step below fails or is unsafe.
- Execution surface: prefer `native-subagents` when the current runtime supports it; use `none` only after recording the unavailable or unsafe surface.
- Native subagent capability discovery: Before recording `subagent-blocked`, check the active tool surface for the integration-native subagent or task-dispatch entrypoint and record the exact missing surface if unavailable.
- Do not record `subagent-blocked` until this capability discovery step is complete and the exact unavailable or unsafe surface is recorded.
- Native subagent dispatch: Dispatch subagents through the integration's native subagent support using the shared prompt contract.
- Join behavior: Use the integration-native join point, then integrate results back on the leader path.
- Preserve this workflow's existing packet, handoff, artifact, and result schema; this section only governs capability discovery before dispatch or blocked-state recording.
