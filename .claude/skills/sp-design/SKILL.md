## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `/sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



## Workflow Contract Summary

- **When to use**: A project needs product-wide interface style, design-system tokens, platform UI rules, or design readiness review before specification, planning, tasks, or implementation.
- **Primary objective**: Produce, refine, synthesize, or audit the root `DESIGN.md` design-system contract without implementing UI code.
- **Primary outputs**: `DESIGN.md`, `.specify/design/design-state.md`, `.specify/design/references.md`, `.specify/design/options.md`, and `.specify/design/review.md`; stable design rules in `.specify/memory/project-rules.md` only when they should become shared project defaults.
- **Default handoff**: After user review, recommend exactly one next command: `/sp.discussion`, `/sp.specify`, `/sp.plan`, or the originally blocked workflow.
- **Execution note**: This summary is routing metadata only. Follow the full contract below end-to-end rather than inferring behavior from the description alone.

## Blocked Exit Contract

If blocked after safe recovery, read and follow
`.specify/templates/workflow-blocker-template.md` and its JSON schema. Never
return only an error or “ask a human”; preserve state and keep agent-capable
repair agent-owned. Set `human_action_required: true` only for authority,
credentials, protected systems, human decisions/reviews, or physical access.
Tailor steps, expected results, failure paths, evidence, and resume action to
CI, visual review, or product decisions. Never claim completion.

# sp-design: Design System Workflow

You are running `sp-design`. This is a design-system workflow, not an implementation workflow.

## Objective

Produce, refine, synthesize, or audit the project's root `DESIGN.md` design-system contract so downstream UI work has a stable visual and interaction system before implementation starts.

## Process

Follow the phase lock, intake, synthesis, review, and closeout steps below. Keep the work design-only unless the user explicitly starts a downstream implementation workflow after reviewing the design output.

## Workflow Phase Lock

- Create or resume `.specify/design/design-state.md` before substantial design synthesis.
- Set durable state with:
  - `active_command: sp-design`
  - `phase_mode: design-only`
  - `current_stage: context-intake`
  - `allowed_writes: DESIGN.md, .specify/design/design-state.md, .specify/design/references.md, .specify/design/options.md, .specify/design/review.md, .specify/memory/project-rules.md`
  - `forbidden_actions: edit source code, edit tests, write CSS/theme implementation files, create UI components, create feature specs, create plan artifacts, create task artifacts`
- When resuming after compaction, read `.specify/design/design-state.md` before continuing.

## Allowed Writes

- `DESIGN.md`
- `.specify/design/design-state.md`
- `.specify/design/references.md`
- `.specify/design/options.md`
- `.specify/design/review.md`
- stable design rules in `.specify/memory/project-rules.md` when they should become shared project defaults

## Forbidden Writes

- source code
- UI components
- CSS or theme implementation files
- tests
- business feature specs
- plan or task artifacts outside the active design workflow

## Modes

Infer the mode from the user's request:

- `create`: generate a new project design system from product context.
- `synthesize`: transform references into an original design system.
- `refine`: update an existing `DESIGN.md`.
- `audit`: inspect whether the current design system is enough for upcoming UI work.

If the mode is ambiguous, choose the smallest safe mode and state the assumption.

## Intake

1. Read `DESIGN.md` if it exists.
   If it declares `design_system.status: bootstrap`, treat it as a starter to
   replace, not an approved constraint or evidence that design work is done.
2. Read `.specify/design/references.md`, `.specify/design/options.md`, and `.specify/design/review.md` if they exist.
3. Read `README.md`, project handbook files, existing UI surfaces, and existing design files. Use the command's shared Learning intake for project rules and reusable lessons.
4. Use project cognition to locate likely UI entry points, token/theme owners,
   reusable component owners, responsive/state patterns, visual or accessibility
   tests, and design assets; verify every selected route in live files before it
   becomes design evidence.
5. Classify the experience separately by work type, surface type (`landing`,
   `product-workspace`, `hybrid`, or `existing-pattern-maintenance`), and
   platform (`web`, `mobile`, `desktop`, `tui`, or `cli`).
6. If references are supplied as URLs, screenshots, text notes, existing design files, or imported summaries, assign each an explicit intent: `exact`, `preserve-structure`, `inspiration`, `extract-tokens`, or `do-not-copy`.
7. When built-in presets help, read one of the shipped preset files such as `.specify/templates/design-library/workbench-precision.md` or `.specify/templates/design-library/workbench-precision.md` and treat it as inspiration, not as a forced brand.

## Synthesis Rules

- Write the project's own `DESIGN.md` as the final output.
- Present two or three project-specific design directions when creating or synthesizing a design system.
- Before proposing them, name the product subject, audience, and single user job.
- Each direction must state a visual thesis, content thesis, interaction thesis,
  signature element, platform fit, state strategy, safe system choices, and any
  deliberate creative risk with its gain and cost.
- Give every direction an inspectable visual artifact such as a moodboard,
  rendered static composition, or screenshot. Ask the user to approve the
  visual direction before writing or replacing `DESIGN.md`; a prose label alone
  is not approval.
- Ask the user to approve a direction; approval refers to its inspectable visual
  artifact and recorded tradeoffs, not only its name.
- Preserve existing project rules unless the user approves a design-system change that supersedes them.
- Do not copy external brand names, protected visual identity, proprietary token names, or third-party file text into the final design system.
- Normalize approved direction into `spec-kit-design-v1` YAML front matter plus readable Markdown guidance.
- Set `design_system.status: approved` and record
  `design_system.approval.status`, the selected direction, and concrete product
  or repository `source_refs`, plus `approval.visual_refs`. Record
  `product_context` and `direction_contract`. Remove unresolved placeholders and generic
  starter choices that are not justified by those sources.

## Output Contract

The workflow output is a root `DESIGN.md` contract plus supporting `.specify/design/*` state, references, options, and review artifacts when relevant.

## Required DESIGN.md Shape

`DESIGN.md` must contain:

- YAML front matter with `design_system.schema: spec-kit-design-v1`
- `design_system.status: approved` plus approval direction and source refs
- product subject, audience, single job, and approved visual reference
- visual, content, and interaction theses plus one signature element
- `design_system.name`
- `design_system.version`
- `design_system.platforms`
- token categories for `color`, `spacing`, `radius`, and `typography`
- component required states and token references
- accessibility intent
- Markdown sections for `Product Feel`, `Platforms`, `Component Rules`, `Anti-Patterns`, `UI QA Checklist`, and `Design Change Policy`

## Review

Before closeout:

1. Run `specify design lint --level ready` when the CLI helper is available.
2. Write `.specify/design/review.md` with:
   - selected mode
   - inputs read
   - approved direction
   - approved visual reference
   - platforms covered
   - design-system risks
   - lint result
   - recommended next workflow
3. Ask the user to review the written design before downstream workflows consume it as locked input.

## Closeout

Close with the design-system status, changed files, lint result, and exactly one recommended next command.

## Guardrails

- Do not edit source code, tests, CSS/theme implementation files, UI components, feature specs, plan artifacts, or task artifacts from this command.
- Do not clone protected brands or copy third-party design files into `DESIGN.md`; synthesize project-owned design principles and tokens.
- Do not let downstream workflows treat an unaudited or contradictory `DESIGN.md` as locked input.

## Project Learning

The CLI is the only agent-facing Learning read surface:

1. Run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@4a631657f75460886dbd12ebe48b14fc11cfe0bf specify learning start --command <classic-command-name> --format json` before deeper non-trivial work.
2. Select summaries by applicability and triggers; use `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@4a631657f75460886dbd12ebe48b14fc11cfe0bf specify learning list --command <classic-command-name> --format json` only to filter or page.
3. Execute one matching card's `show_argv`. Do not parse Learning storage.

`start`, `list`, and `show` are read-only. Current repository evidence,
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, and explicit user direction override stale or
candidate Learning.

At closeout, corrections, retries, route changes, recovery, false leads, hidden
dependencies, validation/tooling/state/cognition gaps, constraints, and near
misses are capture signals. Prefer `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@4a631657f75460886dbd12ebe48b14fc11cfe0bf specify learning capture-auto`
from owning state; manual capture includes summary, problem, action, triggers,
success criteria, avoid items, exceptions, and evidence.

- `fast`: skip unless the task escalates.
- `accept`, `analyze`, `ask`, `auto`, `constitution`, `explain`,
  `implement-teams`, `taskstoissues`, and `team`: consume-only; do not violate
  their write boundaries to capture.
- Other non-trivial workflows: consume before deeper work; capture reusable
  signals at closeout or record a no-learning decision.

The `policy` returned by the CLI is authoritative when prompt wording drifts.

## Adaptive Artifact-Phase Execution

This partial governs artifact-producing adaptive phases such as `sp-design`, `sp-plan`, and `sp-tasks`. `sp-implement` has its own task-level adaptive controller; debug, map, PRD, and other workflows keep their command-specific execution contracts.

Select the execution mode before dispatch:

- `light`: low-risk, single-lane artifact work that is safe for leader-inline synthesis.
- `standard`: bounded planning or task-generation work where native subagents should be used when available.
- `heavy`: safety-critical, cross-boundary, high-risk, or hard-to-packetize work that requires safe native delegation before synthesis continues.

Record the adaptive decision fields exactly:

- `execution_model: adaptive`
- `execution_mode: light | standard | heavy`
- `workflow_status: ready | blocked`
- `dispatch_shape: leader-inline | one-subagent | parallel-subagents | subagent-blocked`
- `execution_surface: leader-inline | native-subagents | none`
- `capability_degraded: false | true`
- `blocked_reason: required when blocked`

Use `choose_subagent_dispatch(command_name="plan" | "tasks", snapshot, workload_shape)` as the shared policy contract. Derive `workload_shape.lightweight_safe` from workload shape and risk keys; do not invent a separate template-only boolean.

Dispatch rules:

- Light mode records `dispatch_shape: leader-inline`, `execution_surface: leader-inline`, `workflow_status: ready`, and `capability_degraded: false`.
- Standard mode uses native subagents when available: one validated lane records `one-subagent`; two or more isolated lanes record `parallel-subagents`.
- Standard mode may degrade to leader-inline only when native subagents are unavailable and no high-risk trigger is present; record `capability_degraded: true`.
- Heavy mode must use native subagents with safely packetized lanes. If native subagents are unavailable, or if the work cannot be packetized safely, record `workflow_status: blocked`, `dispatch_shape: subagent-blocked`, `execution_surface: none`, and `blocked_reason`.

Artifact-writing delegated lanes must use writable, execution-capable native subagents. If the runtime exposes role, sandbox, or permission choices, select a role/sandbox that can write the declared handoff file. Do not dispatch a read-only explorer, reviewer, or diagnostic lane when the lane must write a filesystem handoff; read-only lanes may provide supplemental evidence, but they do not satisfy `one-subagent` or `parallel-subagents` handoff requirements. The lane contract's allowed write scope must include the exact expected handoff path and must forbid unrelated writes unless the command explicitly assigns an additional generated artifact. If a delegated lane returns prose, idle state, or an unwritten handoff, stop or re-dispatch with a writable lane and the valid handoff path.

Delegated lanes still require structured handoffs before synthesis. If delegated lanes were used, consume the one lane manifest and every accepted lane result before final output; do not duplicate the same events into evidence-index and checkpoint logs. If no lanes were delegated, report the delegated-lane field as `none`.

Managed-team fallback is not part of adaptive plan/tasks dispatch. Do not route blocked adaptive planning or task generation to `sp-teams`, managed-team lifecycle language, or a durable team fallback from this command.

## Claude Code Subagent Capability Discovery

- Execution model: preserve the workflow's existing `subagent-mandatory`, `subagents-first`, `adaptive`, or `subagent-assisted` policy.
- Dispatch shape: preserve the workflow's existing dispatch shape; use `subagent-blocked` only after the discovery step below fails or is unsafe.
- Execution surface: prefer `native-subagents` when the current runtime supports it; use `none` only after recording the unavailable or unsafe surface.
- Native subagent capability discovery: Before recording `subagent-blocked`, check the active tool surface for the integration-native subagent or task-dispatch entrypoint and record the exact missing surface if unavailable.
- Do not record `subagent-blocked` until this capability discovery step is complete and the exact unavailable or unsafe surface is recorded.
- Native subagent dispatch: Dispatch subagents through the integration's native subagent support using the shared prompt contract.
- Join behavior: Use the integration-native join point, then integrate results back on the leader path.
- Preserve this workflow's existing packet, handoff, artifact, and result schema; this section only governs capability discovery before dispatch or blocked-state recording.
